See, I was trying to be all romantical, and this girl is cuddling up to me. But at the same time, Pomni is in a swimsuit, so there’s something of a conflict of interest. What to do in a situation like this? Also before any of you say anything, Pomni is twenty five years old. So yes, I’ve known Pomni for a longer period of time, but my girlfriend has the advantage of being a real person. I also move my Pomni body pillow out of the way whenever she comes over because I don’t want her to know. At the same time, I kind of want her to dress up as Pomni. She has dressed up before (she made a withered foxy costume to watch the fnaf 2 movie, the one with Matpat in it) so maybe that could happen. But she might think I’m weird, and I want her to know I’m a normal guy"
1p73zp3,"I live with my girlfriend. One of the things that bugs me in our relationship is communication. I think we mostly struggle with being understood by each other. I would like to give you an example of a situation and hear your perspective.
Recently she got an internal memo within her company that people might be laid off. Nothing has happened yet. She has consulted lawyers. She is, understandably, afraid. I myself have had issues with employment since I managed to change my profession. I am a self taught dev. I live in a dumb country where everything is expensive and you can barely survive on your salary. 
Because of the fear of being laid off we got into a discussion about how she does not like her current job, although it pays well(more than mine). I said I will do whatever I need to do and will support her and find a second job if need be. I am fine with her not working. 
She said - well how is that going to happen? You need a bigger salary.
I replied - I know that but in my field if you do not have five years of experience you are a bum. 
What she said next really annoyed me and this is what I need help with.
She said - well when you accepted your current job you could have asked for a bigger salary?
And here is the thing. I was ghosted a lot. I didn’t have 10 jobs to pick from. I had the one. It was either zero money or this salary. And I chose it. They are bumping it a bit now since I have made six months within the company. How can I explain to her that what she said is rude and that I was working with what I have?
Sorry for the wall of text."
1o6xsjz,I ‘20F’ boyfriend ’19M’ refuses to call me any pet names after an argument. Here’s some background information me and my boyfriend have been together for a little over 3 years now met in highschool . We have been having a lot of disagreements lately and he even broke up with me recently just for us to get back together . I have a friend who’s a bit older than me in my friend group that is ‘29F’ . She’s gay and is into my sister ‘24F’ and we all have a friend group. So my friend group is going to Vegas and my older friend paid and my boyfriend got really upset at this and thinks she has feelings for me even though she sees me as a younger sister . She’s not into me at all and would barf at the idea . He’s uncomfortable with her solely because she’s into females . Even though I’ve explained multiple times that she’s not into me and has a small crush on my sister he refuses to believe me . I’ve truly have never gave him any reasons to doubt me our whole relationship. I’ve never even gave him any reasons not to trust I’m not fully in our relationship and I truly do love him more than anything. Here’s where the fight started so recently my sister and my boyfriend got in a nasty fight because he broke up with me and did it over text and refused to call me to break up over the phone at least and I was sobbing crying his name so she called him he got annoyed that she was upset with him and that caused that relationship to riff and to be honest my family isn’t the biggest fan of his even though he’s a sweet heart to me he really doesn’t try to get to know my family even though I’m super close with his and has gone to weddings with them and stay at they’re house all the time . So he’s not a fan of my family and vise versa . So he’s told me that he’s uncomfortable with my friend ship and that I needed to text my friend and tell her I can’t be near her and that we can’t be friends because he’s uncomfortable by her and I refused to do it because Frankly that’s controlling . And he didn’t like that I refused to do that and I told him that since he’s uncomfortable I’m willing to limit our interactions and keep it strictly friends no hanging out alone or anything. Then he didn’t like that and said he doesn’t trust me that I’ll do that and he needs to see me text her and I refuse so he took two days away from me didn’t wanna text or anything. Then he told me that I never stand up for him against my family and that he’s sick of it and that he would cut off his family for even saying anything bad about me . Which I know is a lie as he told me his family is the most important thing to him and just moving away for college has caused him to have bad anxiety and depression. And I refused to cut my family off as I really do have a small family compared to his big family . Only my sister mom and uncle and aunt as my grandma recently passed away and my dad is dead . He said I didn’t have the same energy in our relationship and I disagree as I have gave up a lot for him even giving up prom so he could go to his godfathers wedding . Since then he has refused to address me as a pet name and said it makes him uncomfortable to say it to me .Genuinely I’ve been trying to move on from this and he said he can’t.I don’t want to end things I really want to try to move over this rock in my relationship?
1p0m928,"ello everyone,

I (23M) recently broke up with my 4 year long partner (23F) when we had plans to get engaged next year. over summer she went back to her home country and was there for a few weeks. She has told me in the past about a childhood friend who has always had a crush on her and he would also flirt with her all the time.

She visited her best friend who also lived in the same city as this guy and they all met up. He was with his girlfriend but she explained to me the entire night he was very obviously flirting with her, some examples in her own words including over the top compliments about how good she looks in what she’s wearing, “wow I wish I took my chance when I could have” etc on top of that she mentioned he would stare at very obviously trying to get to her make eye contact.

my problem starts with her saying she reciprocated the eyes and never really put a stop to his comments which again is infront of his girlfriend. She said she gave romantic eyes back to him across the table. after he had left her best friend asked her if you were single would you have Kissed him and she replied yes. Once she realised I was annoyed her justification was you have 99% of my heart but he will always have 1% of my heart which I thought was ludicrous. we both agreed flirting with someone else is cheating however now once we have broken up (for quite a few other reasons as well not this alone) she is back tracking and saying she didn’t flirt back and it’s not cheating. I just want to know if I’m going crazy and over reacting or if I’m justified.

if anyone wants more details feel free to ask"
1prfhra,"so me and my boyfriend have been together for 6 months. recently we’ve had a few arguments about his snapchat. his snapchat was full of girls snapping him all day and he was snapping them back apparently just streaks and pictures of the wall. i had enough and told him to get rid of them and he argued back that he’s not doing anything wrong and that i dont trust him. eventually he made a new snapchat with just me and his friends and family on it so i was happy for a few days until i noticed his snapscore on his old account was still going up. he also has another old account from before i met him and it had the green activity dot beside his bitmoji meaning he is still using that one as well.
i decided to test him so i made a new account with a random girl name and added his old old account (the one from before i met him) and he added back straight away and texted “what age are you” i replied with a fake age and he said back “wyll” (what you look like?) after i didnt reply for a while he blocked the account. i was obviously upset so i texted him acting as if the girl had messaged me and told me. he said he doesn’t have access to that account anymore and someone must have hacked it (the bitmoji was at his house🤦🏻‍♀️) i just dont know what to do anymore, i love him to pieces and i would never do this to him. any advice on how i should approach this appreciated please"
1oz4q63,"Basically what the title say. Me (24f) and my bf (23m) have been dating for 1.5 years, living together for five months. We were best friends for two years before dating. 

Basically, the man doesn’t express his feelings. Ever. He says I love you and that I look good (when I’m wearing nice outfits), but nothing else. Ever. No nice words, no plans for the future, no little things, nothing. 

He grew up in a family that doesn’t express their emotions. I grew up in a family where we were free to always say how we were feeling and were free with our affection. I feel like I’ve been begging him to give me any words of affirmation ever. He says it feels unnatural and that he’s trying but I literally told myself I would keep track after we had a big argument about it and there’s been NOTHING for almost 2 months. 

He takes care of me. No matter favor I ask I know he’s going to say yes. I’ve got on anti anxiety meds to help with my relationship anxiety (and overall anxiety) and I’ve been actively keeping my mind open for the ways he does express love. I still need to hear it. I’ve tried explaining this to him but he doesn’t seem to get it. I feel like I’m doing all the work instead of being met halfway.

We’re both in busy graduate programs and don’t see each other often. He would say very sweet and nice things to me before we got together but afterwards it stopped. I even showed him the screenshots.

I’m at a loss. How do I get through to him? 

TLDR: I’ve explained in every way that I can to my bf that I need him to say nice things to me about me (ex: why he loves me, what he loves about me, what he sees in our future, etc). He just doesn’t no matter what I do"
1q8q7p9,"I’m a 30F living with my boyfriend (39M). We’ve been together about a year, and I moved countries to be with him. His mother lives downstairs and is very involved in his life (she cooks, washes his clothes, makes his bed, etc.).

Since moving in, she’s made many subtle comments about how I clean, where I put things, whether I help enough, and compares what she does for her son to what I do. None of it is outright aggressive, but it’s constant and makes me feel watched and judged.

Recently things escalated. I pulled back a bit because I felt overwhelmed, and it turned into tension. My boyfriend spoke to her and asked her not to make comments, but then asked me to apologize to smooth things over. I tried to de-escalate multiple times by going downstairs to eat or have coffee even when I didn’t want to, just to reduce drama.

Instead, she avoided eating with us, was cold when I greeted her, and later rejected my attempts at warmth (including refusing a hug/kiss hello). When I tried again the next day, she reacted angrily. I walked away upset.

Later she came to talk and said she didn’t mean the comments badly, but then cried, made herself the victim, talked about her hard life, and even mentioned harming herself during the fight. She told me I shouldn’t tell her son when I’m upset but should come directly to her, insisted I call him to say we made up, and listed expectations like spending more time with her and his sister, knocking on her window to acknowledge her, and making sure she feels included. It felt overwhelming and controlling.

My boyfriend comforts me but still seems focused on keeping peace rather than setting firm boundaries, and I’m starting to feel anxious and resentful."
1pnklav,"tl;dr

My boyfriend and I have been having bad sex for a long time, and our relationship ended when we confronted the issue.

I \[29F\] was in a long term relationship with my boyfriend \[29M\] for four years. We met when we moved to the city for our job and fell in love quickly. At the start of the relationship we had lots of sex but as time went on we stopped putting our hands all over each other and sex became a less regular part of our lives. I started masturbating more and I assume he did too. We never confronted the issue until this year.

We started talking about our kinks and even tried some of them out. Our passion for each other briefly sparked but again it faded. We occasionally had amazing sex but that was only when one of us initiated a kink that was more extreme than anything we had tried in the past, but the passion was never there when we tried to have the “normal” sex we had at the beginning. Over the last month we started talking more and more about it, which sometimes lead to good sex “normal” sex, charged with emotion, but ultimately we ended up “taking a break” because we thought we weren’t attracted to each other anymore. We said we would take time apart to think about what we want.

Now I sit at home crying all day. I have taken time off work “sick” but really I’m just desperately heart broken. I feel like I’m in limbo missing him, but I also don’t know how I can live life without sex with the one I love. I don’t know where else to turn because I feel too disgusting to ask my family.

I know I can’t be with him with sex like this. Has anyone got advice who’s been through something similar?"
1oh05vg,"My boyfriend and I have been together for a little over a year now. When we first met in our masters program, we were a trio friend group with our friend 27M who I will call Eric. In our second year of school, Eric took me out on a date and we both realized we were better off as friends. Shortly after this, my now bf took me out to dinner and that night we realized how much we liked each other. When we started to get more romantically involved I asked him what does he think his flaws are in a relationship and he told me he gets very jealous. Flash forward he discovers that Eric and I had gone out on one date and he took it horribly. Mainly because that was his closest friend in our program other than me. I didn’t see what the problem was because Eric and I realized that we were better as friends. Ever since that day my bf got very insecure and jealous if I talk to guys (sometimes he’d say something in a teasing way, other times he wouldn’t voice it but I could tell by a shift in his body language and expressions) and he didn’t like the idea of me texting one of my guy friends frequently about our days/ memories/ sending memes etc. I respected that so I decreased the conversation. But for months he absolutely hated whenever Eric and I had a funny moment together/ hung out, and my bf used to tell me that he was worried I was doing things behind his back. It stresses me out because I feel like someone only gets so jealous if they themselves are being disloyal. Since then we’ve placed some boundaries and I’ve reassured him when he’s needed it and I feel like it’s been helping a lot. I myself tend to be a jealous person, and I’ve been cheated on in a past relationship but I feel like he gets jealous over nothing sometimes. How do I know if he’s just a jealous person or if he’s projecting/ hiding something?"
1ol2h00,"I've always taken the lead on things in my relationship. Its not something that I've ever liked doing, but my husband is always just ""content"". Nothing ever bothers him, he doesn't have opinions on anything, he rarely voices his thoughts on things and will back down the minute he's even slightly questioned. If I show excitement about something first, he'll reciprocate but wont ever tell me what he thinks first. Its always bothered me, but seemed like something he'd grow out of eventually.

When we started talking about having kids, my husband was very vocally excited and told me he was ready to start right away. I was pretty hesitant and asked that we took another six months to think and get things ready. In that six month span, my husband got a higher paying job (one of our goals) but didnt help with anything else. It was up to me to figure out a new budget, get our health in order and learn about conception. In hindsight, my husband never even initiated a conversation about any of this.

It took us another five months to get pregnant, and while I was drowning myself in information about trying to conceive my husband didn't seem the least bit worried. He told me he just wasn't that concerned and knew it would happen eventually, which I guess it did. He was there when I found out I was pregnant and seemed happy enough, though not as excited as I thought he would be.

Now, I'm two months away from giving birth and as I've reflected on my pregnancy I realized that my husband doesn't want this baby. He's taken amazing care of me, I'll never try to argue otherwise. He does everything that I ask of him, he's been kind and patient when I'm having a hard time and never complains about picking up extra work around our house. But when it comes to the baby, he has absolutely nothing to say.

To start with, he never asks how the baby is doing. I go to most of my OBGYN appointments alone and when I come back from them he'll ask how I'M doing and seem concerned and engaged, but any time I try to talk about how the baby is doing he changes the subject or just silently nods along until I stop talking. His excuse is always that he ""isn't worried because you're not worried"". I try to talk about baby names, he just tells me he's sure I'll pick a good one. I've cried to him about him not wanting to talk about the baby and he'll engage for maybe a day or throw out a name (often ones ive already said I don't like) and then will stop. 

We've gotten into countless arguments about unprepared he is for fatherhood/taking care of a baby. My husband is the youngest in his family so he's never even held a baby before. I tired to get him involved in parenting classes, birthing classes, buy him books, send him videos, give him questions he can ask other father's in his life, ANYTHING to prepare him. He tells me he'll go to the class, read the book, ask the questions, and then a few weeks later he'll tell me he 'forgot'. Every other month we'll have a huge argument about how he hasn't done anything and he'll swear up and down he'll change and then never does.

I did the pregnancy announcement myself, I did the gender reveal myself, I did the baby registry myself, I did the baby show myself. He'd tell me he would help but never even suggested anything. The most he ever did was pay for things. 

At five months, I got fed up and asked if he wanted the baby at all. He claimed he did, and when I pointed out that he has done nothing to show me he's interested in the baby at all he just told me he didn't know why he wasn't doing anything. When I suggested giving the baby up for adoption or having an abortion, he had the worst emotional meltdown I've ever seen him have. He broke down crying and screaming that the baby meant more to him than anything and all he wanted to do was be a father. He wouldn't talk to me for two days after that, then came back to tell me he'd respect whatever decision I made but he really wanted the baby. I decided to continue my pregnancy, but it's like he became even more disconnected after that.

Last week, after finding out he still hadnt attended any classes or even opened any of the books I gave him I finally snapped and told him he was acting like his father. I said the the baby wasn't even born yet and he was already absent and cold toward our son. He got really upset and told me that he loved me and did everything for me, and gave me everything that I wanted. When I told him that there was a difference between loving me and loving the baby he seemed really confused. He just kept repeating that he'd do anything for me and just wanted me to be happy.

I tried to tell him that I feel like he only got me pregnant to make me happy and he quickly shut me down and said he wanted to be a dad before he even met me. He also pointed out that if it was his decision, we'd have three more kids and I was the one who wanted to stop at one. While that's true, I just don't find it relevant to anything.

I love my husband deeply. He's always treated me well and been my biggest supporter in life. Up until now, we've had a beautiful relationship and nothing has come between us since we met. But I also love my son, and I know that if I have to choose between them I'm picking my child. I don't want to have to make a choice like that, but I genuinely don't know what to do. 

To me, it feels like my husband thought he wanted a baby until we got pregnant and now he feels like he can't take it back or I'll be upset. Its so hard to believe that these are the actions of someone that wants to be a day, but I guess I could be wrong. Why would he be acting like this if he does want the baby? What am I supposed to do now? He's a great partner outside of this and our relationship has been closer than ever so what is going on?



Tldr; I think my husband only got me pregnant to make me happy"
1o6lfne,"I, 42M, have been married to wife, 42F, for 8 years. We have 2 kids, 7M and 3F. She's been unhappy with me for years and we are in couples counseling to work through it. Main issues are my lack of communication, emotion, and some ADHD related issues. The ADHD diagnosis was within the last year, but explains a ton of things from as far as I can recall. There are some issues she brings to the table, yelling, cussing, name calling, slamming doors and throwing things, but no abuse to the kids. We have been making some positive progress lately and I recently re-entered the workforce. I feel neglected and my needs are on the backburner with the kids taking top priority since day 1. 

Recently, I reconnected with exGF, 42F, via text message. We dated for less than a year and ended things on decent terms more than 20 years ago. She was there for me during a very tough time in my family and helped me through it without drugs or alcohol. We have chatted periodically over the last 2 decades, so this isn't 100% out of the blue. We both live near our childhood homes and have bumped into one another in the wild. We have both reached out after a breakup, in our 20's, but we haven't both been single at the same time.

The messages were innocent; asking about family, work, and other small talk. Over the last month, we have messaged almost every night for an hour or more. I look forward to everyone at home going to bed so I can escape my current life. The messages are still SFW but exGF sent photos from when we dated and I can't stop thinking about them, the times we had and about her. ExGF still looks amazing, is easy to chat with, laughs at my jokes and seems like she understands me. ExGF even said that we made a cute couple.

I haven't done or said anything that would jeopardize my home life, but my tolerance for wife's usual behavior is less and less. It feels like everything I do at home isn't good enough, or I did the wrong thing or I didn't do enough. Folded the towels wrong, didn't replace the trash bag as soon as I emptied the can because I was outside moving the can to the curb, washed the wrong load of laundry first, etc. These issues have been building up long before exGF and I messaged.

ExGF is currently single, so that is not helping me. ExGF knows I'm married with kids, knows things aren't awesome at home, and isn't nagging or judging me, that I know of. I'm at a crossroad in life. I'm not happy and spend lots of time on personal therapy and meds to help with that. Until recently, I've never even thought about cheating as it is the reason my folks divorced, but it is looking more appealing, like a forbidden sin. This is marriage #2 for me and I thought I chose better, but things changed after kids and postpartum depression. Kid #1's birth and first year were traumatic with time in the NICU and all the fun of a preemie. 

Other information that comes into play. Had a best friend, 42M, that didn't like exGF, so after my divorce, he made sure to tell me not to contact her. His influence was overbearing in my life and he hasn't been around in almost a decade. There were decisions I made during our friendship that didn't reflect my character and I have been questioning a lot of things during that time of my life. ExGF's mom loved me and was brought up by exGF in the last month. ExGF hasn't had a BF earn that since. My family loved exGF too. She set the bar and no one else has tied or surpassed. 

Strangers of reddit, I come to you looking for help. Am I delusional and letting nostalgia cloud my vision? Do I need to discontinue messaging exGF? Do I need to end the marriage and pursue happiness? Do I cheat and wait until that bomb explodes and cleanup my mess afterwards? Is the exGF my Robin and I'm her Ted from HIMYM? Is there another option I am missing?

tl;dr - feeling stuck in current life and marriage, exGF recently surfaced and I feel happiness for what could have been. Or it's nostalgia. Or I'm gassy. Asking for help from those not emotionally tied to anyone or fiscally responsible for the outcome. "
1o82y8j,I got out of a long distance relationship a while ago due to the fact that I wasn’t sure if I was going to be able to save the money for go be with her due to the fact that I was only working part time and wasn’t sure if I was going to be full time. While I was seeing this girl she told me that a friend of hers had confessed her love for her and she had to let them down easy. After we broke up she told me that she wasn’t interested in seeing any one and I would go on these spells where I would tell her how much I miss her and how depressed I was  without her and how I’m sorry for everything I would tell her she was my key to happiness because she truly did mean everything to me I would tell her I’m trying to seek help for my mental health and I would end up keep repeating these messages for a bit. she eventually went out with this friend and she told me she had a crush on him at the time I didn’t know It was the friend that confessed his love to her. I got upset because I was trying to win her back and she told me she wasn’t trying to date and would tell me things to try and make me feel better about how she cherished our memories and loved me but in a different way. I did a rant on ig about my mental health regarding the situation and sent who she’s currently seeing a message saying “do what I couldn’t and be better than what I am” and I never named her and she sent me this long ass paragraph talking about how I was dragging her name through the dirt and making her seem like a slut and she blocked me. I was upset that she didn’t give me a chance to respond to the message so I made another account and contacted her and she did it again and I made another one after that and she finally talked to me about it I told her I was sorry and I did what I did because I was upset. I made an apology video and I don’t even know if she watched that. And I sent it to her and she never responded. I made another account saying could you please stop muting me so I can at least know that you read or saw the message I’m trying my hardest to fix things and you won’t give me the chance I would tell her how much she meant to me and she told me she needed space a couple days later. I was feeling suicidal at this point and I shot her a message the thought of the guy she’s seeing now is the same one that confessed his love to her while we were dating and she said yes I told her about my mental health situation and she told me we could be friends but she still needed time. I posted on my ig that I was looking for a therapist and I heard negative feedback about better health. The next morning she sent me a long paragraph telling me to seek help and to find a therapist and if I love her to let her go and she blocked me again she lied about wanting to  be friends. I proceeded to make an account to contact her again and she threatened to call the authorities if I contact her again and she wanted nothing to do with my healing. I am seeking out a therapist and I am working on bettering my mental health I know what I did was wrong I just don’t know if should be upset with her for not letting me speak or or whole situation with her going out with the guy who confessed her love to her while we were dating. 
1p1e6ok,"I, F35, have been married to my husband, M37, for almost 15 years. We have 2 kids (13,9). Without trying to sound braggy, we are very blessed. We’re financially comfortable and provide a wonderful life for our kids and ourselves through our combined sacrifices and hard work. I’m a SAHM, and always have been. 

It wasn’t something I thought I wanted until I was pregnant with my first child. I realized my husband’s job didn’t allow for me to work and for us both to give the time/attention we wanted to for our kids. So I gladly stayed home. I’m still happy with my choice and don’t regret it at all. I love being with my kids and always being available for them. But the cost of my own independence and identity has been a very dear price for that and I have to manage my mental health very carefully because it’s easy for me to fall into depression and anxiety struggles. I live and love in my to do list. There are no sick days, no time off, no recognition. And your only reward is if your kid is healthy, happy, and decided to behave that day. I wouldn’t give it up for the world, because I love my kids more than anything, but it is incredibly thankless.

Throughout the years, my husband and I have struggled to maintain a strong relationship. For the most part, I do believe he is a good person to the people he cares about. He’s dependable and very self-driven. If all we needed in life were material things, we’d be incredibly happy. Unfortunately, he can be very immature, selfish, impulsive, and is not at all trustworthy. 

Our friends and family think we have it all. From the outside, he comes across as a very considerate and caring husband, and I’m sure he is in comparison to many other spouses. He travels 4-5 days a week for work, but when he’s home, he gets up with the kids to take them to school so I can sleep in. He also does their nighttime routine and handles whatever sports practices and games are occurring when he’s in town. He goes on dates with me when I ask him to go out and rubs my feet when they hurt. We go on a couples trip each year with just the two of us to exotic places internationally. He even took me on a designer shopping spree.

It all sounds and looks like a dream life. And for the most part it is. But last night I had an epiphany and it’s shaken me to my core. I need to open up to someone about it in case I’m going crazy. 

I think we’re the secret family in his marriage to his job and that we’ll never be his main priority. And I don’t know if I can live with that. 

I admittedly have a history with trust/intimacy issues based on abuse growing up from a bipolar and manic depressive parent, and a mom with co-dependency issues who never stood up for her kids or herself. As a middle child, I learned that no one would prioritize my well being except for me. I learned to stand up for myself and the people I cared about. And I’ve definitely brought that into my marriage and family life. I will always speak up when there’s a problem and advocate for what I think is best. I attribute the majority of the life we’ve been able to give our kids to that. 

In the past, my marriage has suffered from infidelity (online only, to the best of my knowledge), constant lying, and my husband prioritizing work over everything else. We’ve been to counseling multiple times to try and work through these issues, but the lying and prioritizing work only gets better temporarily and then he gets back to his workaholic ways. 

He’s in sales and is the typical salesman. Lying is a huge trigger for me. But he’s so good at his job because his gaslighting skills are incredible. 
He is able to easily take a negative and twist it to make you think it’s actually the best thing to ever happen to you. 

For example, we had a vacation planned for the week of Thanksgiving at our timeshare. We go one time a year to decompress and just spend time together as family making quality memories with our kids. He’s not supposed to work on these trips, but he always does. He excuses it by waking up before the rest of us are up to do meetings or emails, but he always has some “client emergency” he needs to handle as well at least a few times during the days. It’s the best we get though. 

This year, we planned our trip and not a week later he has a conference in the same place at a different resort at the same time as our trip. But he explains that it’s actually perfect, because we can just change our trip to after the conference and stay at the resort his conference is at in the beginning. That way our vacation is longer. Yay! Sounds by so great right? Until he adds that we can’t be bugging him during the day because it’s a very important work conference. We probably won’t see him much, because he’ll need to get up early to answer work emails, then the conference will have planned activities during the day and dinner receptions in the evenings. In the couple hours between that, he’ll need to be catching up on the work phone calls, meetings, and emails he missed during the conference. So we’re on our own. “But the amenities are so nice, so just go enjoy the resort. It will be great! But if we see him when we’re out and about, tell the kids to pretend not to know him, because that’s not professional. Yes, the other employees have their spouses here, so it’s not a huge deal, but his boss specifically doesn’t like it, so we need to pretend not to know him in case it gets back to her and looks unprofessional, blah, blah, blah.” 

Ok, whatever. I’m very used to him being over-the-top concerned about his professional image. I hang out with the kids and it’s fine until we all end up super sick with colds. Like no voice, can’t breathe. The kids get over it in a day. I stay sick. I’m STILL sick. I still take them on an entire day tour by myself for 12 hours because I don’t want them to miss a thing since this resort is in an area they haven’t been to. I take them to the pool, I take them to the beach. We conk out every night by 7 because we’re so exhausted and, in my case, sick. Then yesterday, I woke up too sick to get out of bed. No voice, sore throat, migraine and severe head congestion. I had to stay in the room with the kids on their tablets all day while they begged every 2 seconds to go to the beach, the pool, anything. But my body had just given up. Long flight, long days, single parenting. Doesn’t matter how nice the surroundings were, my body was done. It also coincided with the last day of the conference. I saw my husband for all of 30 mins. He told me I looked and sounded awful and he was so sorry. I asked if he’d drive me to the store to get medicine. He said he didn’t have time. I had to order it from DoorDash. It came and I felt well enough to get ready and take the boys to dinner at the hotel restaurant since they’d been cooped up all day. Sent husband a pic of son’s sushi, and he came and said hi for 2 mins, commented that I looked pretty and left. The kids and I finished up and went back to the room to crash. I woke up several hours later and noticed my husband wasn’t back. I checked the time on my phone and it was after 1 am! I called him and he answered saying he was just walking back to the room. He was “networking in the lobby bar with a client he’s trying to complete a deal with.” And “Why am I so upset? He’s here to WORK.” That’s when I lost it. He goes to these conferences, has the time of his freaking life eating fancy dinners and doing private fancy tours and ATV, goes to catered receptions at night, then closes down bars with his “clients” because he’s “networking.” Not one check in text with his sick wife who couldn’t even get out of bed until 7 pm when she got the medicine she had to DOORDASH, because answering work emails was more important to him. Regardless, he saw no issue with drinking until the lobby bar shut down at 1 am, and justified it as “work”. 

This isn’t the first, last, or hundredth time there’s been an incident like this either. This is just the time that it’s been so blatantly obvious that I can’t really ignore it anymore. He will always prioritize himself and his career over our family and I will always have to prioritize our family for the both of us. But my epiphany is that I don’t have to prioritize HIM anymore. 
Is that asshole-ish? 

I’m in a place at this point where, to me, it’s not enough for a divorce. My kids love their dad and he is a great dad when he’s actually around. He also superficially takes care of my needs better than I think a lot of other spouses do. But I’ve never been anyone’s “important person” or priority and it’s the thing I’ve always wanted most. I grew up having to be strong and stand up for myself, but I wish so bad that I could put that responsibility down and let someone else handle it for a change. And I feel like I keep giving him opportunities to do that and stupidly expecting him to do it because he’s my husband. But he doesn’t unless it’s convenient for him and works with his own priorities to himself and his job. 

Is it okay if I give up on that expectation and stop letting him in so I stop getting hurt? Like no more couples trips, no dates, no watching the same show at night. No more intimacy, physical or emotional. Nothing that could build back up our relationship and bond just for me to let him in and get hurt and disappointed again. He’s a salesman in everything, so when he does those things to build our bond it’s always to benefit himself. 

I know it will cause a lot of emotional distance and will damage our marriage even more, but we’ve been to marriage counseling three times and it’s been brought up every single time and he always acts apologetic and gets better for a month or two and then we’re back here again. 
I feel like a shrew all the time trying to force him to spend time with us, to let work go for a minute. Or even to just proudly show us off instead of hiding us, and him making it seem unprofessional or like people won’t take him seriously because he has a family and he outs them first. Shouldn’t that actually be more commendable?! I feel like Stuart from SNL, begging for attention like “Look at me! Look what I can do!” It’s so exhausting and I’m so tired. 

I’m sick of being what is essentially his secret family on the side to his marriage with himself and his company. Like a booty call when he has time. For my own mental health, I need to stop prioritizing him constantly at my own detriment. I need to become my own person. I plan to start taking steps to have my own career when we get back. I’ve looked at some options. I’m cancelling the activities we had planned as a couple for the remainder of the trip. I booked them anyways, because heaven forbid he make the effort for one on one time that isn’t physical. And I’m getting my very first tattoo. It’s going to be small script and say “When you rely on someone to feed you, you give them the ability to starve you.” I need the reminder on my body constantly. To stay strong. To only rely on myself. 

Is this unfair or too harsh? Is there a better way to handle this? 

I can’t divorce him while the kids are still living at home. As their mom, I KNOW it wouldn’t be the best thing for them in this situation and Reddit will have to trust me on that. It would also be a waste because after my childhood, this marriage, and everyone I know’s relationships, I’m pretty convinced I’m too emotionally needy for the kind of relationship I want. Book boyfriends are unrealistic. I will NEVER get married again or open myself up emotionally to someone. Enough is truly enough. I actually desperately want the freedom of only relying on myself for my own happiness. 

Is there even another path to this situation besides that honestly? I’m not open to being vulnerable anymore. I just simply can’t be. I would love some advice on how to handle this. I don’t need or want a moral judgment. I would love to know if this has been anyone else’s experience and what they’ve done or even if you’ve been on the other side? I am a huge proponent of trying your best to look at both sides when making decisions. "
1otk39t,"I have had male friends my whole life,  I just seem to vibe better with guys and find them easier to be around than girls.
In order to protect our friendship and friend group, I have a strict rule about dating friends and close friends of my friends.

But this guy...he's somehow wormed his way past all my usual defenses and blockages without even meaning to I think.
He's not exactly the most soft, gentle, or polite guy around. He's kinda gruff, stand offish, and you're typical guys guy....except with me.
He takes care of me when I drink too much when we all go out, never let's me wander around events or large areas we go to alone, is there for me when I need someone to talk to, and just always strays me with respect.

I still dont quite know how I feel about him exactly, but I can definitely feel something growing and it scares me because I dont want to ruin what we already have, or how good our friend group is. Plus, to top it all off he's my best friends other best friend. 

Does anyone have any advice in this situation?"
1pjq7cm,"Hi Reddit, this is my first ever post here so please be gentle- throwaway account as my partner knows my main account. 

I'm seeking some advice or guidance on what I should consider before speaking with my partner. So anyone who has been in a similar or same situation, please pass down any advice, and outcome on if you regret or are happy with your decision. 

**TLDR:**  
I met a guy, H \[30M\] in 2022 and had a strong connection, but distance and timing kept us from exploring it. In 2023, I began a relationship with my current boyfriend L, \[29M\], and things have been amazing, we live together and have future trips planned. Still, H has been in the back of my mind, and after he recently reached out, all my old feelings and “what ifs” resurfaced. I am now confused, guilty, and unsure whether you want to stay with L, explore things with H, or take time alone to figure out what you actually want. I am seeking advice on how to handle the situation.

**\_\_\_**

**Full explaination:**

I am not sure how to even write this or where to begin so I will start from Oct 2022 when I met H \[30M\] at an interstate event when I was 21. It was FREEZING and raining this night and as it was an outdoor festival, we couldn't avoid it. 

H and I hit it off and we spent a part of the night together just vibing until he wanted to go to a different stage with his friends- I stayed where we were because I convinced H to let me borrow his beloved Defqon jacket and I promised I wouldn't move from this spot until he came to collect his jacket. Due to a bad experience, H said he didn't trust girls from my city but I made him a promise that I wouldn't hurt him (this may be of relvance later). H trusted me with it and once he was done at the other stage, he came to collect it. We of course exchanged numbers and socials so we could stay connected.

A few days later, I flew back to my city and H and I messaged back and forth daily. We made cute promises to each other saying that if we were both single the following years for XMAS&NY, we would spend it together (so 2023) and all things like that. We tried to find time to fly to each others city to catch up but could never find time as we both had such busy schedules- H was on call full time and had travel committments and I was working part time and was focusing on completing my thesis at the time. 

Along comes March 2023, I met my boyfriend \[29M\] but at the time \[26M\], let's call him L. We first met at the gym but never spoke until we matched on a dating app. 

We instantly hit it off and we had so many interests in common and it was just bliss. We couldn't get away from each other and I knew he was my person and I wanted to be with him. During this time, I didn't really think of H because of how exciting things were progressing with L. 

I ended up telling H about L and let him know I wanted to pursue things further with L. H and I agreed we would stay friends (lol- you know how this goes) but we didn't really. H was very respectful of the relationship and he distanced himself. I checked in with H twice in the Jun-Aug 2023 but the conversation didn't really amount to anything out of respect for L. 

I won't lie, H is someone who always pops into my mind, and I spiral thinking if jumping into the relationship with L was the wrong thing because a part of me wishes I pursued things with H. I always bury these thoughts.

I feel especially bad because H told me he got screwed by a girl he loved from my city and I after I promised him I wouldn't do the same, I basically blindsided him with the relationship with L. Upon looking back at old messages, I can see that he was really hurt by it all. 

I am not often active on socials but for my birthday this year (2025) I made a story post and H replied to it with a Happy Birthday and wishing me well. THIS sent me for a spin- it's been so long since we last spoke so I replied with a Thanks and also wished him well. It has been 3 days and we have sent single messages to each other just talking about what we have been up to and it's so nice and it is making me question my relationship and if I am even ready to be in a relationship. 

I know I sound so selfish but I am not sure what to do, on one hand- I love L and want to be with him and I feel so bad that I am even thinking this way but due to my selfishness and feelings, I feel like I have to take a break from L but it's hard because we live together and it would be hard for him to find a rental at this time. L and I have been through so much together and have shared so many good memories.

I blocked H because I felt bad and then instantly unblocked him- I don't know what is wrong with me but I just can't seem to let go the idea of being with H and actually seeing if we could ever work out. 

L and I have trips planned together in 2026 and I am so excited and can't wait to travel with him but I feel so bad that I am having thoughts of leaving him to potentially see where things go with H. However, I don't know if I am so stuck on H because of what we could have been or because of how abrupt our ending was.

I am not sure if these thoughts have come up because L and I have been in a difficult spot for the past few months and we both have a lot of mental health things going on, OR if I am genuinely questioning this relationship. 

I feel like I need to break up with L for the sake of working on myself and finding out what I actually want but I am so scared of the thought of losing him and what we have.

Please help with any  guidance or advice on what I should do. 

I do speak to a therapist but I don't think I am ready to share this with him.

If you made it this far, thank you so much for reading. 

Regards, a really stressed out gorl."
1obuklm,"I am having some issues with my (26F) boyfriend’s (25M) mother (67F) and I am unsure of what to do. We have been dating for almost 2 years and I really do see a future with him. He is an amazing guy and is the sweetest person I have ever met. 

His mom has become a bit of an issue over the past year especially, she relies on my boyfriend heavily for emotional support and often makes odd comments that make her seem jealous of me being his girlfriend. 

Just to make a long history short here are some bits of the situations/comments she has made over the past year: 

“Why don’t you open my car door for me too?” After my boyfriend opens my car door (she says this one a lot, he usually opens her door too but sometimes I guess he forgets and she is always quick to say this) 

“When we were on family vacation you were too focused on your girlfriend, it felt like we were all just watching the two of you be on vacation” 

On the same vacation mentioned above, she felt the need to announce that I made her son cry once and mentioned that she didn’t like that we always had to sit by each other at dinners, at the airport, etc. 

She saw the ring on my left hand that my bf had given me and was like “oh are the two of you pretending to be married?” and basically laughed at it 

When she first met me she made it a point to keep trying to hold my boyfriend’s hand while they were walking in public (she still does this sometimes) 

One time my boyfriend and I got up to go fishing super early and she didn’t realize I was behind him but he went to tell his mom that we were going fishing and she was like “come lay with me” like as in lay with her in her bed…. 

She has asked to sit on my boyfriend’s lap on numerous occasions randomly 

She got mad at my boyfriend when she found out his small life insurance policy he got through work was signed to be left to his sister and not her. (She felt she deserved to be the benefactor on it, despite her being old)

Etc. 

Anyways now moving onto the most recent story, I was telling a story about a friend’s wedding where her MIL kissed her husband on the lips following the mother son dance, and how I found that odd (I understand different cultures do different things but these people were not of a different culture than mine and everyone there found it odd as well). We all laughed and agreed it was odd. His mom then made the joke to him “oh do you want me to kiss you on the lips?” which is whatever, she was being dumb and almost commenting on how weird it was. A few minutes later she said to me“oh what would you do if I did that hahaha” and I jokingly was like “oh I’d have them draw up the divorce papers right then and there”. I thought that would be the end of joking about it because it is weird and I don’t really want to think about my boyfriend kissing his mom on the lips at our wedding. 

And then later (when I wasn’t in the room, I heard it from the staircase that she did not know I was on) she jokingly was like “kiss me on the lips!!” to him while he was hugging her goodnight, they did not kiss from what I heard but it just bothers me that she ""joked"" about it again, it had been a few hours since dinner and idk, I just don’t feel like that was necessary to joke about again. I haven’t brought up me hearing the joke when I wasn’t in the room because I know it makes him feel weird. He is very embarrassed by how she acts around him and does not enjoy talking about it. He knows how I feel about everything else and it has been a point of contention in our relationship for the past year. 

According to my boyfriend, she does not make these odd comments or jokes when I am not around. I do believe him (maybe I’m just being naive) but I don’t understand why she acts like that only when I am around. Especially since my boyfriend says she never acted like this around his last relationship and it was never an issue for him and his ex (i directly asked him that question, he didn't just randomly bring it up to throw in my face). 

Any advice would be appreciated, please be kind and respectful of the situation. It has been really hard to navigate and I am unsure of what else I can do besides remove myself from the situation if it makes me this uncomfortable. I mainly would like to know if there even is a way to handle this? I know family issues, especially with mothers, is such a delicate topic but I am so tired of feeling uncomfortable whenever she is around. She lives a few hours drive away so we don't see her a ton but when we do, she is just a lot to handle. Also, if I am being dramatic, please let me know! I am open to being totally wrong about the whole thing!! "
1o0g8za,"Hello! Im not sure if this is the right place to ask for help, but this has been really troubling me for the past few days and Id like to hear someones opinion about it. Im sorry in advance cause this will probably be a long rant. (Also Im a bit embarassed cuz this sounds dumb and childish as hell)

Around 6 months ago, I met this guy because of another friend of mine. We immediately got close to each other because surprisingly enough we have several things in common, especially our passion for videogames.

We ended up exchanging socials and hanging out alone with each other, mostly by playing videogames every night together, constantly chatting and sometimes, free time permitting, meet up and just hang out, even casually as friends.
We got very close, and so I ended up introducing him to my online friends, so that we could all play together, since Im not really a person who keeps friendships separated.

Thats when my online friends started to joke about how close we were and started to call us a ""married couple"", and at first it was fun yk, but then he ended up mentioning it in our private time too, and thats when we started to act more sweet to each other. I'm a shy person so I would just follow his lead, whenever he would flirt with me, call me pet names, say that he loved me etc. 

It really was all a joke, but then it escalated a lot and he would tell me that he loved me minimum 10 times daily. I ended up opening up to him, and he did with me too. I told him about my exes, and how Im worried because I feel like Ill never find someone right for me because of my mental health and my traumas that I still carry with me, and every time he would tell me ""oh Ill be patient for you"", ""Ill love you properly"", and allat. He would also get extremely jealous of all of my male friends, especially one in particular, because he likes to call me pet names as a joke a lot, and he would always say stuff like ""oh I just dont like that guy because of how he acts with you"", and like Im not sure why he would care but ok whatever, right?

At this point, I started catching feelings for him, and I felt like he was too, this thought grew even stronger when a friend of mine started to call him my boyfriend and not only he never corrected her, but he started to lean into the boyfriend thing in our dms too. He would always call himself my boyfriend and say things like ""oh but husband and boyfriend are the same things no? So youre my boyfriend"" (this relates to the joke we had with our online friends). 

This was really confusing me, so in the end I ended up asking him if he liked me, and he was SO confused, he ended up telling me that nothing could happen between us.
I questioned him about several things, at first I was like ""why were you calling yourself my boyfriend tho?"" And he told me that ""he found it funny that that girl was calling him my boyfriend""
I confronted him about him being a jealous bitch for every single boy I would talk with, and he said ""so what? You get jealous too"" and ended up justifying himself by saying ""oh thats just how I am"".
For all the ""I love you"" he gave me, he said that they were all either a joke or platonic.
And after all of that I told him about the times he would tell me that we would move in together, he would love me and all of that stuff, he was like ""oh but I didnt think you took it seriously?"", so I said ""you sounded serious tho? And the context was so serious too"" and he said ""well maybe it will become true, you never know"", and I got so mad at him and told him ""you cant be saying this after telling me that there will be nothing between us and that you dont like me?"", he asked for explanations, I said ""because if you say this, it means youre not excluding it, which goes against what you said before"", he ended up dodging the question and yapping bout sum ""I cant understand why we cant just act like we did before??""

After he said that he started to shift the conversation, and even if he said that it was all jokes, he started to ""beg me"" into not changing anything about our friendship, saying that for him there was nothing wrong with saying these things between friends, even if he did say that I was the only one he does this with, and I do believe that since he basically spends 95% of his time with me, but anyway..
I asked him multiple times, ""isnt it weird tho, to hear that I love you now that you know I mean it in a romantic way?"", and he kept on saying that ""he never said that he didnt want it, I just assumed he would find it disgusting"".

Anyway, after this, the convo kind of died and we started to talk normally again, exept the fact that I tried to talk to him like Id do to any other friend of mine, and he got so pissed, as if I owned him anything special. He started to assume that I was mad at him even if I was talking normally, and he started to act in a passive aggressive way towards me. He said ""why are you so mean to me?, oh I like you too!! Is that what you want me to say? Do I need to lie to make you happy?"", I apologized and went back into talking with him as I did before.

He never acted like this, and it just got worse lately, I confessed a few days ago, and ever since, its like he has been walking on eggshells around me, constantly mentioning how I like him, and getting immediately frustrated as soon as I try to pull a bit away or mention other people.
One recent event would be when he started to joke about how I liked him AGAIN, and I didnt really care about it, till he told me ""what if I wanted you too?"", and I got mad and told him to stop it, because I felt like it was cruel for him to joke about this even though he told me that there will never be anything between us. He acted confused and asked me ""stop doing what?"", I didnt reply and he got pissed after 10 mins or so.
After this he started to act dry and demanded that Id go play with him a few times till I replied and agreed, just then he went back to his normal mood. For me it didnt sit right, because it felt kind of possessive and controlling, but he kept on insisting that its all jokes and its all platonic, so its confusing me?

Not only this, but after I confessed he never once stopped bringing up our ""marriage"" even if it was a joke, he never stopped saying that he loved me and allat, actually I think that it even got worse, and sometimes it feels forced too, if that makes sense.

Anyway, Id like to hear someones opinion about this, because Im sure that he cares about me a lot, but if this is all platonic and jokes why does he keep on being so controlling and possessive? Is he just dependent from the attention I give him or what? I dont know..

By the way, I forgot to say this, but I am totally fine with him rejecting me, as a matter of fact Ive been trying to move on, but he keeps on getting annoyed as soon as I even try to talk with someone new or show that I lost interest just for a bit, he keeps on sending me these mixed signals and I genuinely dont know what to do because I feel like I could lose the entire friendship over this just by setting boundaries, and feelings aside, I really do care about him and cherish his friendship a lot. I accept the rejection, I just want for him to act like it."
1oalpt2,"I (25F) have been with my boyfriend will say his name is “Ted” (27M) for 3 years.
A few weeks ago I asked him if he was still in contact with his ex. Long story short we had a treesome together with her (just for fun) but I asked him to net text her without telling me. So I asked and He got defensive and said no, that I was being paranoid. Last night I asked again, calmly. He said no. So then I asked to see the messages, and he refused, said I was trying to manipulate him and that I didn’t trust him. I told him, “Either show me or I’ll go home.”
He said, “Then go.”
So I did.

Later he texted saying he deleted her from Snapchat and Instagram so there’d be “no more confusion.”
But I know he talked to her more than he admits because I saw the messages myself. (He doesn’t know that.) 

When I confronted him again, he said I was “paranoid” and “obsessed,” trying to make me feel like I’m crazy for noticing the lies.

I finally said:

“Don’t try to manipulate me, Sam. All I wanted was the truth. You know exactly what I’m talking about, but you’re trying to make it look like I made it all up. I wouldn’t be this sure if I didn’t have proof. Go to sleep. Good night.”

He hasn’t replied since.

Now I don’t know what to do.
I love him, but I don’t know how to stay with someone who lies to my face and calls me paranoid when I know the truth.
What do you think I try to excuse him because he still a good guy and the messages that I saw was “shes here we’ll talk later” or “what’s was the photo ? Don’t answer she’s there”, I know they will never be together anymore or is it already over between us and the guy like him shouldn’t be in my life?

1odwhqu,"I've been speaking to a therapist for a few months and one of the things I have been talking about is my issue with communication. I tend to avoid the hard conversations and avoid conflict.

With my relationship that has meant I've haven't been bringing things up that bother me.

My girlfriend has depression so I never want to bring it up when she's feeling low but then when she's feeling okay, I never want to bring it up and ruin the mood and don't want her to react badly. After talking with my therapist I realised I just needed to do it.

I asked my gf if we could talk and told her about the issues with communication I've been talking about with my therapist.

I mentioned I understood the problems with communication are on me but I have a few concerns/issues within the relationship I'd like to bring up. One of the issues was our sex life, it is pretty much non existent and has been for a while.

Whenever I mention anything sexual my gf will change the subject.

I also mentioned I fee like I do a lot more for my gf than she does for me and gave a few examples. She got annoyed and accused me of blaming her for any issue in the relationship.

I pointed out that's not what was happening, I was just talking about the issues I have had with the relationship. I mentioned her reaction was pretty much proving me right for why I've avoided the conversations previously.

She just said again I was blaming her for our relationships problems but I just told her again that's not what was happening. She told me to drop it and said I was being harsh towards her.

How would you handle this?

Tl;dr I voiced concerns I’ve been having regarding the relationship to my girlfriend and she accused me of being harsh and blaming her."
1onoard,"Background: My boyfriend(26M) and I (29F) have been together 4 years and living together for 3 years. We moved out of the state that we met in where my family lives and we moved into his hometown where his family lives. We have been living with his parents the past 2 years. He has had some substance abuse issues during our relationship every so often. About a year ago he had a withdrawal seizure from Xanax and alcohol. He picked back up slowly again and about 2 months ago after telling him to slow it down and he didnt I decided to move out. ( I didnt get the chance to though) He asked why I changed my phone password and I told him it was because I was planning to move out and love him from a far while he figured his shit out. He took it BADLY (he was very sad and didnt want to lose me) and he did a complete 180 without me saying you do this or i do this… and its been a lot better the past month. Hes been doing good in college classes and supporting me slightly in my nursing school classes. (Helping me wash and dry my scrubs sometimes, packing my lunch for clinical sometimes, etc.) 



Today is our anniversary and last year I got him a big “3” balloon, rose petals, small candlelit pathway to the 3 ballon in our bedroom and I pulled out all of the old letters we wrote to one another and I wrote him a meaninful card. I got him his favorite candies and snacks and his favorite wine. Hes a huge plant nerd so I also got him some plant stuff. So I low key was expecting him to do  little more than usual this year because I did so much last year and we were broke last year and I still made it work. Last year he didnt do much and he told me he felt bad because my gifts were better than his. 
This year we are not broke we have a good amount of money. He had time off with the car and he even gave me his present early this morning and I told him I hadnt had a chance to do anything yet because I was out of town without the car and he said yeah this year he had the upper hand in gift buying. Then he proceeded to give me flowers and my favorite chocolate (Ferrero rocher). No card, no actual present, no special words vocalized from him about how he feels about me. 
I wasn’t expecting jewelry, a vacation, or some big ticket item. However, I just told him less than 2 months ago things were bad and I was planning on leaving. He gets an opportunity to make me feel amazing for a day and show me how much he loves me and he picks up chocolate and flowers when I asked him to grab some stuff at publix on his way home from work last night… It was just convenient for him. I was expecting a gift that shows he *knows* me or a handwritten card that expresses his love for me. 

Now I am contemplating what to do next. If I give him lots of gifts then that could show him that I accept his treatment… He is sleeping and I should be getting him a gift rn but tbh I just want to do nothing this year. Another piece of me was thinking to just get him a 99cent card and only write happy anniversary in it. Maybe grab a small pack of his fav candy. Another part of me wants to get us a couples counseling appointment printed out and stick it in a card. Like happy anniversary mf. 😂


TLDR: boyfriend(26M) and I (29F) have been dating 4 years now and last year I went all out for his anniversary gift and this year he gave me flowers and candy after we almost broke up recently. So now I just want to give him a couples counseling appointment printed out in a 99cent card or nothing at all. "

I am very much over this person, there is no attraction left for me there and we reconnected as friends after being no contact for a while. We only talk occasionally. He’s been in a new relationship for a year, and she is now pregnant.

Over the past couple of months, he has sent me messages to say he is still attracted to me and thinks about me sexually very often. I didn’t reciprocate and tried to steer the conversation away, but he kept trying to bring it back and at some point said some things that are inappropriate for a man in his situation to say. This happened more than once before I shut it down clearly. 

I have now said very directly that I don’t want him to tell me those things, it’s not appropriate or respectful to me and his partner and it creates an emotional burden for me to know something his partner doesn’t. He said he will respect that, but I still don’t feel good about the fact that this happened and I don’t really want to stay friends.

For context, there is past behaviour on his side that makes this a pattern rather than a one-off, he has a history of cheating too. I don’t want to be involved in any secrecy or be the person holding information that isn’t mine to keep, but I’m also really hesitant to contact his partner since she’s pregnant. 

Is there anything more I can do to handle this properly and protect my peace? "
1om71hh,"Short backstory. Im in my early 30s, currently living and working in Hainan, China. The island is like Hawaii. I am an active guy, with several hobbies. I dont party or drink. I love sports and gym, and working out, but I also enjoy playing guitar, reading books and playing DnD online. My issue is that I've been struggling with relationships for a while. Its 50% due to moving and travelling so often since COVID. I'm able to get many dates but few of them ever have turned into a real relationship. My longest relationship ever has been 6 months. Just writing that is actually insane.

I recently ended a short relation with a Russian girl because she had to go home for a long time. We tried long distance but it didnt work. Kinda broke my heart because I really liked her. I am at the point in my life where I am so ready for a long term commitment.

After a few months Ive gathered the courage to try dating again. I am very busy with work so I can only go on about 1 date every weekend. This weekend, I had organized a date with a local girl named ""Alina"" (29F) on Friday. Late on Thursday however, another local girl named ""Cassidy"" (29F) told me that she is so bored this week and wants to leave her city on Saturday to come visit me for the whole day. Now I am very open minded about going on dates and seeing if I like someone. Many times, the sparks just aren't there are we mutually say goodbye and never speak again. Normal. What I didn't expect is what ended up happening.

On Friday the date with Alina went really well. We had dinner at 7h30pm. She is Chinese and very feminine, extremely outgoing and into fitness, short, fit body, funny, and lives in the moment. Excellent English. She seems like the kind of girl who would want to move in with her boyfriend pretty soon because she lives with her parents. She wants 3 kids, but doesnt like the idea of marriage \[for some reason\]. She barely parties or drinks.  I really liked her. We kissed and held hands at the end. I missed the last train back to my city at 10pm because I lost track of time. We walked super far along a beautiful broadwalk. She seems very caring, charming, and the sparks were very present between us.

On Saturday the date with Cassidy ALSO went very well. She met me at a coffee shop just outside my apartment. She dropped off her car at my apartment soon after so that we could pickup my ebike and a spare helmet. We then spent the rest of the next 7 hours riding the ebike together all across my city. We had lunch at an amazing wooden tea house, and it started to rain. We sat and drank coffee and chatted for 2 hours while waiting for the rain to subside. She is extremely, fiercely independent. She is tall and slender, and is a surfer girl. She seems to have no close friends. She likes to go to thailand and party about twice a year. She loves to cook. Like, LOVES to cook food for people. She said she wants to open a restaurant one day. I could relate so much with her independence, and dare I say loneliness.  At 7pm we went to a restaurant to have dinner. Came home and watched a movie together. Ended up kissing on my couch for a good while. She went home at 11pm. She is very tender and loving, and there was also a large spark between us.

Help. I like both of them. There wasn't one particularly good or bad thing about either Cassidy or Alina that would make me instantly pick one over the other.  
I am in an impossible situation. It is stupid of me to tell them both that I am dating the other? I just want to be transparent and not lie.

How do I choose? Flip a coin? Vibes? Look for huge green flags and cross reference each with their red flags? I've never been in this situation before. It's like there is no wrong answer but I like them both......... FUCK.

TL:DR  
I went on two dates this weekend with two different girls. I really like them both. I don't know how to choose which girl is better for a relationship :/"
1padqba,"Today I, (23 F), finally stopped talking to my ex (22 M) of 3 years, after 3 months of my boyfriend (25 M) not knowing. For context this ex was horrible to me, he would hit me, pinch me, fat shame me (I’m 5’3 and 57kg), and constantly belittle me disguising it as a “joke”. He expected me to put 100% of my time and effort into him while giving me so little. He also isolated me from my friends and family. I endured this kind of treatment for a whole year and a half of our 3 years of dating. I stayed for as long as I did because I loved his family, I grew up in a lower class unstable household while his family was the stable high middle class family I had always dreamed of having. I also always just felt so attached to him, I don’t know how to describe it, but I was very emotionally attached to him even though he wasn’t good for me.

Well, after moving back to college for my senior year, I decided to finally end things because I had become so appalled by him and his behaviors. Well, soon after I met my now boyfriend through a class with some mutual friends, and we started dating not too long after the breakup. We started going on dates about a week after, and put a label on things after a week of going on dates. We’ve been dating for over 4 months now. He is amazing, he’s very attractive, he’s sweet, considerate, can cook, always insists on helping me with my house chores, absolutely hilarious, has never failed to make me feel heard, constantly complimenting me, and things are exquisite in the bedroom. I honestly believe I struck gold with him, and have done everything in my power to maintain a healthy and loving relationship with him. Everything in my power except still being in contact with my ex…

This is where everything gets tricky. Even though me and my ex were broken up, I still remained in contact with him without my boyfriend knowing. The first month I didn’t talk to him, but then he reached out, and we started talking. This was a dumb decision on my part, I know, but apart of me still felt emotionally responsible for him. Our conversations were mostly me trying to emotionally help him through things, as he was really struggling with our breakup, and has never had friends he can talk to about his feelings with. This ended up leading to us hanging out a few times when I was back in my small home town in Georgia. While we hung-out I discovered he was absolutely obsessed with me. He constantly stalked me on social media and had written me a long heartfelt book about how he missed me and still loved me. He took me to nice restaurants and bought me so many gifts like a huge bouquet of roses, he would compliment me constantly, and just make me feel like the only girl in the world when we would hangout after our breakup. I would be lying if I said I didn’t enjoy it. I would like to stress that I never got physical with him. When I would go back to college we would text but very little since I was usually with my boyfriend and always ignored him if I was with my boyfriend. This went on for about 2-3 months. It was just so nice to feel so pampered and given such treatment.

What messed it all up is when my ex saw a post my boyfriend had tagged me in. It was our 3 months, and my boyfriend made a sweet little instagram story post about me. Well, when my ex and I were hanging out at a nice restaurant he decided to stalk my instagram again while I was in the bathroom, eventually discovering the post. He was livid, taking me home and then blowing up at me in his car. He was so angry and hurt, yelling asking how I could hurt him like that, and begging me to leave my bf for him. I told him no, and that my bf comes first to me, because I couldn’t forgive my ex for how horrible he was to me in the past, and I genuinely love my boyfriend. He had had enough and we didn’t talk for a few weeks after that. Well, I eventually texted him checking up on him, because I dod still feel oddly attached to him. He would reply back, and we would have simple conversations, but never too deep.

I did this for a while until TODAY a friend of mine sent me screenshots from a conversation she had with his brother, where his brother was talking bad about me for still texting him and having a boyfriend. This hurt me, to know he was talking to his brother about me, and in such a horrible manner but still texting me like things were fine. This made me finally block him on everything, no explanation why, I just did it. But now I can’t help but feel this empty feeling, like something so important to me is missing. I don’t understand why I miss him now, I didn’t when we first broke up, and he was so horrible to me, so why do I miss him now? I should be happy I can finally fully focus on my boyfriend, but I’m not.

So this ends with the questions, why am I feeling like this? Why do I miss him now? How do I get over this in a healthy manner?

LASTLY, I would like to end off stating this is NOT am I the butthole story. I know I’m not a good person for what I did to my boyfriend and my ex, but I don’t have anyone who can help guide me to make good decisions. Both my parents have never truly been in my life. That’s why I’m on Reddit asking for help. So please don’t shame me for making poor decisions."
1pw00f0,"I (25M) met my wife (25F) during the first year of my undergrad. We were in the same university and the same year. Both of us were the sort of nerdy outliers, but together we were perfect. We quickly became best friends. We did everything together, from sitting together in class, to studying, to going on trips. We did not really have many friends except each other. During the second year, I asked her out and we started dating. After finishing undergrad, both of us got into PhD programs at universities that are around 50 miles apart. We got married, but lived in separate homes to avoid the daily commute. I visit her every weekend.

But things have changed recently. I feel that after starting our PhDs, I sort of doubled down and became even more serious about studies and career. She went the other direction. She does the bare minimum required to progress with the degree and prioritizes her social life. Now, during this winter break, she had the option of going on a long vacation with her friends. I could not go since I have several interviews for summer internships during the break. One was on December 23rd, another on December 28th, and another on January 3rd. I could, however, go on short multi-day trips during this break. Since we only spend weekends together throughout the year, I insisted that she stay with me so that we could spend several days together. We planned a four-day trip around the city where we live. I did not force her, but I did insist, and she did not resist much either.

Now, the interview on January 3rd was not initially scheduled. Just the day before Christmas, the company reached out to me, with January 3rd being the earliest day they could interview me. Unfortunately, that was a day we had a trip planned. I talked to my wife about rescheduling that trip because this is my dream company, and a research internship there would significantly boost my career. I wanted to discuss which other day we could reschedule the trip to, but this seemed to break something within her.

We had a huge fight where she essentially asked me to leave and go back to the city where my university is. So I came back here and spent Christmas alone, and I will probably spend New Year (which is also our anniversary) alone as well. She managed to find another friend group and go on a vacation with them at the last minute. We have not talked much since then, but recently she sent the text below, and I do not know how to process it. I have told her I will think for a couple of days and then reply.

“Ideally I would want to do all the adventurous stuff with you. But I know you don't want any adventures at this point in your life. You just want to focus on your work and skip joy till you reach some arbitrary position in life. I don’t want my life to be this way. I have lived my entire high school and undergrad life this way. But now I am tired and I want to enjoy life. I want to spend money on things even if it is not the financially optimal decision, I mean obviously I will never go into debt, but I would trade reducing savings for joy. Ideally, I want you to experience joy and adventure with you, but since you are not ready, I want to enjoy life with my friends. I cannot force you to become someone you're not. So even if it is not ideal, I have chosen to enjoy life with my friends when you can’t. I know if we meticulously plan, then you might be able to do the things I want to do. But I don’t like treating trips as some serious missions which I have to plan weeks in advance. I like to be spontaneous and I just want more from life. By forcing me to spend time with you in this break instead of with my friends, you tried to force me to become like you. I find this impossible to accept. I didn't try to force or change you even though I was frustrated by how busy you are always. To plan any trip with you, I have to take your appointment like 2 weeks in advance. I cannot just assume you will dedicate a weekend to me if I request. For all these things, my attraction towards you has decreased. I don’t enjoy sex with you as much any more. I feel trapped with you.”

1nvhf63,"OK, so I try to make a long story sort of short I’ve been in back-to-back abusive relationships. They’ve never been healthy and I’m not talking about mildy abusive. I’m talking about like life altering, emotional, physical, psychological abuse. My bf and I met online he told me he was looking for his forever, and I was too. Said he was done with all the drama and the crazy he’s had a pretty rough run as well. I was very honest about my previous relationship taking all I had really I was exhausted. I am exhausted that I felt like I had died a long time ago and I was just waiting for my body to catch up, but there were parts of me that I would never get back and that absolutely devastates me. He said, he understands exactly how I feel, and after moving in with him and seeing all of the insane notes and horrible things written all over everything that his ex left him with after he had to get a restraining order against her, I truly believe that he does understand how I feel. I told him I’m not for the cheating shit on your side. I’m not for the games. I don’t play games. I’ll just leave. I’ve been hurt way too much and I’m way too old to continue to allow myself to go through any more abuse and dealing with being cheated on not being able to trust my partner. He said he feels the same way. Well, we have moved very quickly. After going on our first date we spoke through only text for almost 2 months, Didn’t even hear each other‘s voice until we saw each other face-to-face for our date. We pretty much fell instantly in love with each other, but we had spent a while building a connection before meeting each other. He asked me to move in right away and I did I have children One of them is very young just turned four when we met he is now five. He has no contact with his birth father and my boyfriend is essentially his father now and he is an amazing dad to him. I could not have asked for a better partner parent with I think my son actually loves him more than he does me. He is extremely attentive, extremely caring extremely kind we almost never fight and when we do, it’s very short-lived. With the exception of a a couple months where things got pre-rocky, but even then we still didn’t fight. He had out of the blue just started acting like he didn’t care he was never home. He was always making excuses to leave and what he was saying that he was gonna go do did not up to the amount of time he was actually gone for a quick trip to the store took hours to get a pack of cigarettes, but be extremely suspicious when he woke up in the middle of the night one night in a panic over his phone. He was looking for it. It was right next to him. I’ve never gone through his phone at this point. I’m honestly afraid to. Anyways, I had this overwhelming feeling like something was going on. He would get a phone call and then he would takeoff. He would have plenty of cigarettes and he go get cigarettes and then he would leave in the middle for hours and not even come back with cigarettes, swore that he was doing nothing as men always do and I couldn’t really catch him. He’s very guarded with his phone very guarded. He is extremely careful to never leave it behind, or out of his hand pocket or reach. When I found the stuff on Instagram, it was by total accident. I just got a notification that someone was on Instagram. Check out their feed and I did. I clicked on the notification. And what I saw broke my heart publicly not even a month after we had started dating after I moved in all that he was hitting other women up and I don’t mean just like oh hey how you doing no like straight up he couldn’t have been more clear about trying to get with them. If not actually getting with them because they were responding. He’s a very good looking man and he’s very charismatic. It’s not hard for him at all to have whoever he wants whenever he wants. And at that time like I said, we had a rough patch we weren’t even sleeping together anymore like it was a serious problem. I felt so unwanted so just in his way I guess you’d say, and when I would tell him that and bring it out to him, he would just brush it off. Kind of just ignore me. You would just say if I didn’t want you here you wouldn’t be here so all the while he was completely ignoring me he was giving all these other women all his attention and when I found it and I brought it to him and I said OK I’m gonna go. This is obviously where your attention lies and that’s totally fine but it’s not for me. I’ve been through more than enough and I don’t need to allow myself to be put through this again I just do not cannot emotionally handle that kind of pain anymore. I’m exhausted tired of hurting tired of being tired. And although I love this man with every fiber, he truly is so unbelievably good to me except for that one little bit with that one little bit is a lot. When I brought it to him and showed him everything he blamed a friend of his he said he was always using my phone wasn’t me. It was him and when I noticed what he was doing, I could’ve stopped it, but I’m not stupid and he still maintains to the state that it was not him not all of it anyways some of it I made it pretty good points that is hard to believe that it could be a while but him I know how he talks if that makes sense. He told me that he loves me. He does not wanna lose me. I went ahead and packed my stuff and left and came to stay with my late  mother’s best friend for the time being, our health isn’t great. She needed my help anyway. After moving here we had an emotional talk. I cried. I explain that I don’t think he does want me, but maybe he wanted to want me but the reality is he just doesn’t or he’d be here at that time. He was putting me last if at all on his list of important things or things that matter at all, you had no time for me. He was short with me. He was irritated with my presence. It seemed like I told him that it’s just better if he goes and he said you haven’t even given me a chance to show you that I do love you and that I do care and then I do want you can you please just give me this one more chance I promise I won’t let you down. Fast-forward to now obviously I gave him a chance cause we’re still the other. He took a complete turnaround back to being exactly how he wasn’t perfect unbelievably perfect but in all that chaos what he did got swept under the rug and I totally forgot because he’s that perfect that he hurt me like that. Well, I went to send him some pictures dirty obviously yesterday I sent the pictures along with a snarky comment about how I may not measure up for those girls on Instagram, but I at least look better than he does in the shirt that I was wearing of his in a very provocative way. Needless to say I pissed myself off. I hurt myself. Well I guess I should say I remembered what I had somehow forgotten that he had done and I was once again flooded with all of that same hurt and all the same feelings, I felt when I found out. I don’t know how but somehow in the shuffle of moving and everything else it had all managed to get swept under the rug but now I’m flooded with this complete devastation all over again. It’s extremely overwhelming he says I can trust him but how if he’s doing those things in public what is he doing in private? If he could go that long every day doing that and come home and look at the eyes and tell me he loves me and that he wants me there and how can I ever believe that he actually does love me because you don’t hurt somebody love like that. And how am I ever supposed to trust him to be faithful to me when I’m not around if I can’t even trust him to be faithful online or to give me the truth about the whole situation instead of trying to blame somebody else? I don’t know what to do. He’s my dream man and all other aspects of life but I’m really fucking hurt. You know I’m not a cheater never have been. I don’t believe in getting even. I believe in walking away, disappearing completely from that person’s life, which is what I usually do. I know that I’m not emotionally equipped to handle the cheating questioning the dishonest inability to trust that will drive a person insane I’ve been there. I don’t wanna go back down that road. But I believe I lose him or if I leave him I truly don’t believe I’ll ever find someone who is more perfect for me and every other way and here’s the thing I could probably handle an open relationship because that’s really my thing is honesty just be honest with me. Don’t make a fool out of me. I would prefrer a monogamous relationship. But I think I could handle an open relationship as long as I put first and our communication is clear and I know that I am being told the truth 110% whether I like it or not. I value honesty and I hold it above all else. I relationship with my friendship, family with everything. Honesty is the most important thing to me. If I can’t depend on you to tell me the truth and be honest with me then how can I trust you at all?  Idk. Am I making a mistake? I’m a just setting myself up for failure? Idk what to do or think. I’d like some unbiased outside opinions."
1oj7ul3,"Hi! 

For context, I'm probably something that's called avoidant, when it comes to attachment styles. I know it, everyone knows it, since it's kinda evident. I don't really like being emotional in a relationship, I very rarely feel to say ""I love you"" (or not at all), I'm rarely affectionate and overall I don't feel like I'm loving my partners. It does happen in the beginning of any relationship, but it slowly fades away until it stops completely. 

It happened in my last 3 relationships (each over 2 years).

The real problem is when all the emotions come to me at once when I'm breaking up with someone. Like I'm doing it and I'm ok for a day, two, or a week, but after that? Damn! I feel like they were my entire world. I know it's grief, but I can't differentiate it of love. 

What I'm going through right now is a relationship with a lot of rough paths. We started with the wrong foot because I still had feelings for my ex (or maybe just I think I had, something I described above), we went through them, but our personalities are way too competitive and confronting. I don't feel love. I don't feel anything. I feel that we tried, even though clearly not enough.

It's been two years already and I'm not sure how to handle it. On one side, I might feel again everything once I break up. And this is fu***d up because I might try it again, just so I can lose feelings again. Or I might just try harder to keep the relationship. 

Basically, the question is, how do you cope with being an avoidant and only have feelings when it's too late? "
1pv4per,"My girlfriend (19F) and I (19M) have been dating for 6 months. I love her and while this isn't my longest or first experience with dating, this my first healthy one, and so i'm trying to unlearn anxious habits I developed in my past relationships which involved a lot of emotional abuse. 

I'm TERRIFIED of people being angry with me. I don't really know how to respond if my girlfriend expresses reasonable frustration with me over something I did (Minor stuff: leaving the fridge door open, being late, etc - stuff where she's not quite mad, but clearly in a bad mood). 

This looks like profusely apologizing, focusing on the fact that I didn't mean to upset her, and rambling about how I won't do it again. In the moment, I don't realize how that reaction is annoying and sounds like I care more that she's upset. Shes told me before that she's never really angry with me over this stuff, but it still freaks me out when I feel like I messed up her mood and it's been challenging for me to unlearn this anxiety I have surrounding relationship conflict. I think it might be a maturity problem too to be honest but I want to be better. 

I'm talking about it with her tonight because I want to ask what I could do differently, but if anyone has advice on not taking minor stuff personally as an anxious person, please share."
1q44kjm,"Hey all, TLDR at the top because it's gonna be a long one. This has been going on for about 8 years. I am looking for help on navigating this friendship situation.

TLDR: My college friend group (all guys age 29-31ish) has a discord server that we've used for a decade. There's one person in that group that bullies me, uses mod-set role privileges to exclude me from text/voice chats, and removes my permissions/reactions/messages. The rest of the group does nothing about this or otherwise responds with ""That's just Lenny, he's a bully""

The cast (fake names):  
Me. Lenny (the bully). Devin and Harper (husbands, Harper is the server creator). The Rest (8-10 other guys less directly relevant to these interactions).

Sorry if you are reading this and recognize the story - I'm only coming to Reddit because I genuinely don't know who else to ask.

My friend group has been together since college and we have a discord server that we used in and after college to stay in touch, share memes, play games together (esp during covid), and really just remain in each others' lives. The core group is about \~15 active people people, but the server has a total of about 50-60 people that we have collected that are a mix of other online/irl friends that play various different games with us that most of them are inactive or have the server muted except for @ mentions of the role for the games they play.

Lenny was not a part of the original college friend group. He went to another school and joined the server because he played league and was friends with Harper from before college, most of us have seen him IRL probably once or twice. Lenny was fine to me initially for the first few years, but then sometime about 5-6 years ago he started to bully me around the time Harper gave him mod privileges in the server. It started small - like removing my reactions and gaslighting me, removing or muting me from chats, etc. Then it escalated with him actively trolling me in the chats. The Rest kind of dismissed it because he did some of those things to other people as well, and nobody really took it as personally as I did. The weird thing is I genuinely don't understand why he targets me like this. I have never had any specific interaction or fight or disagreement that started all this, it's just now server lore that ""Lenny and \[me\] don't like each other"" despite him not having something specific as to why.

It got better because about 2 years ago he just stopped joining the chats because Devin and Harper stopped joining also. Devin and Harper moved away from the area that our friend group lived to go follow Lenny in another state halfway across the country. Once they left, they decided to join another very online community and pretty much spend all their time in that one instead (which is fine and their choice, its just kind of sad they have left our friend group behind). The only time we get any communication from Devin or Harper is when they want to play a specific game with us, otherwise it's pretty much radio silence and has become a very transactional friendship. Harper and I had some falling out a while back around the end of college - really just not compatible personalities there was not one specific incident: we both can be hardheaded about things and that can clash over long times. It worked out when we started seeing them less though. We can still be civil towards each other and will play games together, we just aren't as close as we had been before in college.

Fast forward over a couple years, the server has died down a bit. Three friends developed very active lives in another city and have joined less. One friend travels for a living and is hard for him to find time. The Devin, Harper, and Lenny as mentioned before don't really have anything to do with us unless they want to play a specific game. That leaves Me and about 4 others will still regularly game together a few times a week.

Then it started again. A new game came out that Lenny likes, and he made a hidden chat with a hidden role for it - so that only mods and people he gave the role to could see it which included basically everyone who was still active except for me. I didn't notice specifically until I saw steam notifications that they were playing a game but didn't see anyone in the discord... until I dug a little bit. I talked to a couple of the Rest about it and they pretty much dismissed it and said that ""Yeah Lenny's a bully"" or ""Even Stan doesn't like him"" (Stan being our most universally wholesome friend).

Every time Lenny does something like this it really gets under my skin. I'm losing my mind because I feel like nobody in the friend group cares about the way he treats me, and completely dismisses my complaints without really doing anything about it. This server is about a quarter of my friend/social/support network and I would hate to lose it, but I'm seriously considering leaving it if they don't address this.

Does anyone have any advice about how to navigate this situation?

Is it worth confronting Lenny directly after all this time? The one other tiem 4 years ago that I did confront him, he brushed it off and said ""it's harmless"" after I said it really hurts to feel this way.

How can I make sure I don't lose my friendship with the Rest?"
1q3dm4r,"The story of the most painful challenge of my life....  
  
I was step parent to the most perfect and awesome little guy I ever met from he was 1 to 4. He was so fun, cleaver and always laughing!  
  
When we met he was 1, and his dad wasn't much in the picture at the time, so I stepped up to the responsibility as best as I could and did all things I thought a dad should do with his son, including doctor appointments during workhours(I have a very successful corporate career so this was a big sacrifice), kindergarten meetings, swimming lessons, reading, teaching, and tons and tons of playing. I tried to help him grow, teach him how to be a good person. Making him succeed and be happy in life was my nr 1 priority. 

  
Many many career and social opportunities were relinquished for this boy, and I have no regrets still to this day. I loved every second of it.  
  
I grew to love the boy as if he was my own, and I could tell the feeling was mutual, he called me dad and thought I was his dad for a while(we agreed to not have that complicated conversation with him until he got older and his own dad would be more present). He asked me to protect him, and I did everything in my power to do so, and I did, I held him, never exposed him to danger, even stepped in front of his mom when she got too upset(probably cost me my relationship, but no one can persuade me that its normal to screech at a toddler as an adult), I even got a bit upset with the kindergarten caretakers(no violence) because an older kid was playing too rough with the smaller kids, and didn't know boundaries. 

I would protect the little guy with my life if it had come to that. No hesitation at all. When a boy of 3 looks you in the eye and ask you to protect them, how can you not?   
(In this case we were learning the bike and he asked me to hold him safe)

Fast forward... His mom dumped me... She didnt love me anymore, and I dare say the feeling was pretty mutual, though I could never have the heart myself to leave this boy that at loved... more than anyone in this world. Anyone.... Never. But she did, which I understand.

One reason I stayed in the relationship for this long though, was that she was a very aggressive and temperamental woman. She was harsh, very harsh, on everyone, me her friends, family and worst of all, her tiny little innocent son which did his best to gain his mothers favor. And he was so so good.... always better than the other kids in every way, ahead with colors, numbers, letters, social understanding, yet she always complained about the things that weren't perfect instead of appreciating the things that were.

She was so harsh with him, like full adult volume screaming into his face so he would cry because he was so scared... IDK maybe its not so unusual but for someone who believe in gentle parenting, it was so rough to see her communicate with, a toddler, the way that she did, over the most ridiculous things like spilled food. Toddlers are EXPECTED to spill food, if you demand otherwise you are cruel IMO and put them up against unrealistic expectations that they can only fail.

Im happy we broke up, but I feel so terrible that I can no longer help him curb her worst outrage, I just know he will be targeted even more now :(   
It eats me up. He is such a good boy, but she comes from a traumatic childhood herself with insane high expectations so she passes that on to her son, and pushes him way too hard IMO. He is so amazing, so smart, so cleaver, so well behaved, and still, it is not enough to her.. He is ufcking 4 years old!!!!!!!   
  
And she tries to run him like it it some sort of military camp...

It breaks my heart that I cannot protect him anymore, compliment him when he is being extraordinary, which is all the time! As he deserve....

When we broke up, she decided I could see him once a week for 2 months. I begged for more, I knew due to her shifts that his swimming lessons would be tough for her, same with certain days of the week, so I offered to take him on those days, she denied it. 

After those 2 months, she didn want me to see him anymore at all. I had been his first almost everything for 75% of his life... She even told me that she had told him that ""In 2 months X will not come to visit you anymore"", as if it was MY decision and me who rejected him!!! Such a fucking evil lie.... as if I abandoned him??!   
  
I was BEGGING to get any time with him I could, but she was so vengeful and petty, I think she wanted to punish me, and that it mattered more than the trauma her own son might feel from being ripped away from his stepdad in such a harsh way.

Its been 6 months now, and I still cry almost every day... For him, I hate that I couldn't be whatever it took to keep our family together and for him to grow up in safety and harmony....

How do I forgive myself, and move past the fact that I failed this boy. Despite trying my hardest."
1ox7gxf,"My BF 41 (M) White American and I 27(F) black hispanic, my BF has a harsh attitude towards others including his parents and doesn't like to take accountability for his actions or words that affect others.

  
We have been dating for 13 months, and things have been like a roller-coaster. When he is in a good mood, he speaks to me nicely, and he can be really loving and caring, as long as I agree with what he says and his perspective on everything.  He considers that having fun and maintaining a peaceful relationship.

 As soon as I try to say something of my own that doesn't align with his perspective or that can affect his AI research, he usually becomes rude, condescendingly speaks to me, calls me names, accuses me of manipulation and of gaslighting him, being the problem in the relationship and ruining everything, and when I don't speak out my mind it also bothers him (English is not may native language, so I thought at first it was the reason our communication skills were poor)

I have tried to explain myself , he usually acts like if he is listening then cut me off, speaks over me, shuts me down, forcing me to admit I am wrong and my reality is distorted and all I do is trying to paint him as a narcisist when he is a good man and I need to apologize. 

During our moments of addresing what was said that caused a misunderstanding between us that hurted my feelings  he denies it and even if I have proof he said he doesn't care and it shouldn't be a big deal. 

Whenever I try to address his disrespect towards me he makes it all about him self and my reaction to his actions the main cause of the problem, then proceeds to hung up the call on me and ignores me until I go back and apologize. 

I love him reason why I have been doing things his way to make him happy but this time that he called me retarded and compared me to an autistic and Down syndrome adult he took it too far. 

"
1on6pkl,"For some context, I have been dating my girlfriend for 7 years. There have been many ups and downs, of course, especially since we literally grew into adulthood together. She taught me many things as well (I am terrible at reading people's intentions), but we still managed to make it strong. For the most part, I thought I was pretty laid back. I mean, I really spend almost all my time doing school work, especially now that I am in grad school. With that, I only ever had one boundary - don't go clubbing. It might sound controlling, but it's the one and only boundary I have. In my eyes, it's a place only single people go. I guess I wouldn't understand people just want to dance amongst strangers, but personally, I hate that. Quite frankly, as well, I wouldn't want my girlfriend to put herself in a position where guys hit on her (seems sort of disrespectful to me). People have mixed opinions on this, and I understand, but it's literally my only boundary...

Then comes Halloween night. My girlfriend's sister-in-law booked us for a rooftop bar along with some extra friends of ours. As mentioned, I was fine with it because it said 'BAR'. But once we entered, it was just a full-fledged club. Granted, the view was nice, but damn, I did not wanna be there.

You might ask a few things like, at least we went together, or it wasn't my girlfriend that booked it, so why does it matter? To answer the first part, I didn't want to be there either. The loud noise and strangers congesting you mess with my head so badly (some things buried from childhood). Answering the second part, I believe she did know. A week prior to going, I offered to go elsewhere, a haunted house with a bar (pretty cool; the entrance was a bar, and if you wanted to head to the haunted house, they took you in a bus and so on). A week in advance, yet the excuse to not want to go was that nobody would be driving, so why head all the way north (this did not happen, we had three separate fuckin cars to go to the club). Adding onto this, I am crap at planning, but my gf is amazing at it. She's the type to create a comprehensive itinerary for her vacation. I almost refuse to believe she did not even look at this place, considering all the coordinating with friends to match costumes. So, yeah, I was somewhat taken aback when I realized it was a club and sort of got tricked into going.

Fast forward to being there, and I am not a dancer. I am just a lanky white guy dressed as a damn chipmunk lol. For a whole hour, I got antagonized to dance by her and her friends (I wasn't even drunk, sadly). I didn't budge because, again, I am not a dancer and I don't find it fun. Writing this out, I sound like a buzzkill, to be honest, but I find enjoyment in other things, like camping or going to bars with actual activities! It appeared I was not the only one who did not enjoy going either. All the boyfriends of my girlfriends' friends were standing like bricks, just as I was. It was just my girlfriend and her sister-in-law who wanted to stay. 

Now, when it comes to situations like this, I think it's fair for a pure democracy. If the majority of the people don't want to be there, then we leave; vice versa. But that did not happen. Instead, my girlfriend's mood slowly turned into annoyance. Sure, I was just standing there with my drink, but I prefer that over dancing. Instead, she did not want me in her sights because 'it makes her sad seeing me just stand', and suggested I Uber home. Like, what kind of fuckery is this? I get tricked into going to a club, which reminds you, broke my one and only damn boundary, and now I'm essentially getting kicked out. I have an entire exam and research project to worry about. I had planned in advance for this, as I can barely go out anymore, and I just get caught off guard like this? To me, it's wild.

After an hour, everyone decides to leave because clearly all the guys (especially me) and some of her female friends did not want to stay any longer. I guess it's hard to find enjoyment in a place like that. All the guys say the same thing - 'Wow, that was so much fun, guys'. Just as a joke, because we obviously hated it. I was mentally out of it, so on the day, I didn't say anything. Fast forward to the next day, everyone was texting in the group chat before work (yes, we also all work together). I was showing up an hour late and just texted, 'I'm too tired, had too much fun last night.' Purely as a joke. Purely as a joke, but I suppose with not the best intent behind it, especially since I still felt backstabbed. My girlfriend, on the other hand, did not take it so lightly. She called me 'annoying as fuck', thanked me for ruining everything, and told me not to speak to her the whole day, amongst many more things. Not only did I get screwed over the night before, have my one boundary broken, but now I am in trouble for being slightly pissed about it (not even in a mean way either!).

She tried apologizing near the end of the shift, but after she got mad at me, I was mentally clocked out. I felt stupid for being tricked, disrespected, and now I should just accept her apology? I did not speak to her for the rest of the night; I just went home. I never get seriously mad at her, but this is a first.  

The next morning, she texted me a long apology, but also did not forget to include how my 'joke' was distasteful. Yet again, this pissed me off. If I am going to have my one boundary broken, I can certainly make a joke about it if I want to. I sent a quick cold text back, and we just went back and forth.

The texting just escalated to her essentially breaking up with me? I am still not entirely sure. Stating that she's just holding me back from success and that she messed up by breaking my one boundary, and a lot of other stuff. Essentially, concluding with the fact that she does not know how to fix it, and quite frankly, I don't know either. If she had never tipped the iceberg by getting pissed at me, I would've done my thing and suck it up. But now, I have no clue what to do. Do I just let her go? It still all feels surreal, especially since I'm unable to focus on it due to an overwhelming amount of schoolwork I have. The last thing she said was 'good luck' (for my exam). I gave it a like, and that was that. I don't feel happy about it at all, but I am not entirely sad about it; I still feel a bit of anger/disappointment. But I also know that deep down, I am not sad because I mentally have not processed this as a breakup, just a period where we aren't speaking.

So yeah, for those who read all the way up to here, do I just forgive her? Or am I being a wimp about my boundary? Any advice or critism is appreciated \~"
1o2aewp,"I 24 F just had my birthday yesterday. My boyfriend 24 M and I have been dating for 6 months and friends for about a year. This birthday is the first one I have spent with him. I dont want to sound ungrateful but my gift was 2 blocks of chocolate and a box of chocolate. When giving them to me he said he couldn't find flowers.

It wasnt wrapped, there was no card. Hardly any thought went into it. It was literally a gift he could have gotten on the way to my house. I love chocolate and have a huge sweet tooth but I am trying to stop eating as much and he knows that. He doesn't have a job currently so cannot afford anything fancy which is fine with me because I dont care about the cost of the gift. For his birthday I got a box and some white paper and drew all his favourite things to use to wrap the box containing his presents. It took me hours. I wasn't expecting that level from him but I guess just a little more than just handing me chocolate.

We spoke about it and he understood where I was coming from and apologised. He said in relationships you learn what people like and how to love them. Which is true but I feel it's common sense to put even a tiny bit of thought into a gift for your gf. 

After speaking I still feel weird about it. I feel like a brat for being upset but I also feel like I deserve more than that. 

I just want more than the bare minimum for once and it hurts that I can't get that even on my birthday. I keep crying about it and I hate feeling like a spoilt kid that didn't get what they wanted for Christmas. 

Am I being dramatic? "
1o7sdqu,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years, and living together for 3. Since the beginning of our relationship he knew that my end goal was marriage. I don't want kids unless we're married, and as old fashioned as that sounds that's what I want. I love living with him, and being with him but I'm starting to feel like he's just stringing me along. He's had excuses for everytime I bring up marriage, first it was ""I need a better job"" so he went to school and got a promotion in his career. Still waited.... and then it was ""I'm not financially stable"". I've told him it's not about being financially stable, it's about the gesture of showing he's committed to me for life. He could propose with a ring pop for all I care, and I could care less about an actual wedding. His family is also on him about proposing, every time they see us they grab my hand and go ""oh still no ring"", and it's obvious he's now out of excuses. I'm tired of begging, and I'm embarrassed each time his family brings it up seeing that he has no answer. 
I'm ready for a husband, and for kids. I'll be 27 soon, our 6 year anniversary is coming up. I'm starting to wonder if the ring will ever come. 
To add, he does say he wants to be with me forever but I also am starting to wonder if that's said just to keep me around. 
Has anyone been in this situation? Any advice? 
I'm just sad. 
"
1nyk8ad,"My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and 3 months, and as of recently, things have been great. We have gotten a lot better at communication, with fights here and there.

I'd like to preface this story with a few details. 
1. At the point we broke up, we had been dating 10 months and I did not ever think I'd be getting back with him. I am also not someone who sleeps around, this is my first serious boyfriend outside of casual dating and talking stages.
2. I had also recently found out he had been texting his ex.
3. There are problems outside of this that I'd be happy to address in an update or comments.

Okay, here we go.

I was graduating high school in a few weeks by this point (held back a grade) and I had been feeling him distance himself from me, so of course I tried to communicate, to no avail, and by the time he was communicating back, I was pretty uninterested. He goes through these periods where he's mad at everyone, he says it's not about me, but it makes it feel like I cannot talk to him.

So, the weekend before my grad he backed out of being my date and I broke up with him. I was not planning on talking to him.

So I have a friend (18 M, trans (this does have to do with the story, you'll see why), who pretty much immediately after I broke up with the bf, told me he liked me. I was fine with this and even flirted back a bit. He invited me over to his house but the first time I said no, because "" I don't want to make any rash decisions I will regret later. ""

I ended up coming over the next weekend, and as probably my 7th mistake at this point, smoked some 🌿 and drank a little. My friend started making moves on me, and I don't really remember how, but it escalated. After that, it was cut off pretty immediately as life was too complicated for me.

A few weeks later, I got back with my bf, but I have never told him because I know he would break up with me if I did. I think I have some attachment issues, and I really feel guilty about what I did, even though technically it isn't wrong.

TLDR; I broke up with my bf and then slept with someone while high and tipsy and feel awful about it because I have not told him."
1o2cnay,"My boyfriend suffers from depression and crashing from his ADHD meds and he just got a job 6 months ago that took away his one WFH day so he said he’s exhausted and that’s why he’s been detached. Hes been very dry and doesn’t seem as enthusiastic or happy or interested and it’s been making me kind of anxious and upset. Our relationship is only about 6 months old, but 4 months of that was long distance with multiple trips to see each other. I know that eventually the honeymoon phase will end and am very experienced with long term relationships so it’s fine but I can’t deal with the emotional rollercoaster. I have a history of getting codependent, anxious and insecure so idk if I should validate my feelings when he gets like this by bringing it up but it’s honestly making me depressed. I also don’t really know what good it would do to bring it up. He’s getting treatment but it doesn’t seem to be helping in this regard. I’m trying to have faith that if there’s a problem he’d just tell me but the behavioral changes are a little upsetting. 

TLDR: my (33f) bf (33m) has become despondent and dry whereas he was excited and very loving before. He suffers from depression and adhd and his job is very emotionally exhausting. "
1protd8,"Throwaway because this is my first time posting on Reddit. I’m looking for outside perspectives and honest opinions on whether my plan makes sense.

My ex and I are both high school seniors, and we broke up a few days ago. For context, I have anxious attachment and abandonment anxiety, and I was cheated on in a previous long-term relationship. She has had very unhealthy past relationships with men and is extremely protective of her mental health, to the point where she tends to overanalyze relationship dynamics.

We started talking over the summer. I asked her out early on, she said no, so I backed off and kept things friendly. A few days later she initiated more texting and snapping, so I asked again and she said yes. We hung out a couple times, then I went on vacation and we FaceTimed constantly and got closer. When I got back, she invited me over and from that point on we were basically a couple. This was late July / early August.

For the next few months (September through most of November), things were genuinely great. The only real issue early on was me crossing a boundary by making an insensitive joke, which I fully acknowledge was wrong. We took a short break, then got back together and officially started dating in mid-September.

The problems started when my football season ended and I suddenly had a lot more free time, while she stayed extremely busy with work and figure skating. My anxiety spiked, and I started interpreting her being busy as her pulling away. I began over-texting, calling, and repeatedly bringing up fears of being abandoned.

She then went out of the country, which made communication harder, and my anxiety worsened. When she got back, she had her final senior skating performance, and I continued pushing emotional conversations even though she was overwhelmed. Eventually she asked for space.

During finals week we barely talked, but I started therapy and realized my anxiety and lack of emotional regulation were damaging the relationship. After that break, we went on a drive where she told me she felt overwhelmed, unhappy, and thought I had been emotionally immature. She ended the relationship.

The breakup itself was calm and respectful. She is still snapping me, still has me on her private stories, and even checked in on me the same night we broke up. That’s part of why this doesn’t feel completely “final” to me.

My plan is to not reach out for 2–3 weeks and focus on therapy, emotional regulation, and becoming more consistent and secure. If I do reach out, it would only be if I genuinely feel more stable and not driven by anxiety.

I know we’re both young and are about to graduate, but she’s the first girl to make me feel loved and I want to be the one who makes her feel like that.

My questions are: Is my plan insane? Is my interpretation of the breakup mistaken? And do you have any suggestions to help?

Thank you all for reading"
1ovk3ba,"The story is a little more complicated than it sounds. I have been with my boyfriend for over 2 years. Every aspect of our relationship has been great except for one thing, working. Since I’ve been with him he has had multiple job and has either quit, or been fired. He has pretty bad ADHD and he hasn’t been diagnosed with autism, but he has a lot of signs pointing in that direction. He gets overwhelmed at jobs to the point where he makes himself physically sick and they send him home, or he calls off. Which leads to him either quitting or being fired. I have been very patient with him up to this point, but we are starting to struggle financially since I am the one paying most of the bills. I have had serious conversations with him about my concerns and he understands them completely, and I do see him try, he will go weeks without an issue and then one will start. I don’t want to resort to breaking up with him because of this, but I need some sort of solution because I cannot continue to support us both. Any suggestions, or advice on what to do?"
1oqqp6i,"I’ve had a very hard time reaching out and talking to anyone in my life about this because I try to keep it between me and my partner as I think communication is healthy. However, I feel like I’m pushing my self to a point of no return and would like some reassurance that everything is okay. (I do want to add that I’m seeing a therapist to help me with my stress)

To start, we’ve been dating for 2 years and we’ve finally decided to start living together. There were a few red flags but I believe I was so in love with her that I’ve ignored all till now.

Let’s start with finances. I grew up my entire life poor and swore to always work hard for me and my future family. The issue is that my partner doesn’t want any room mates and during the time we weren’t living together I was living with one (woman who I knew for multiple years) just for the sake of saving money. My partner didn’t like that and our lease at the time wasn’t done yet but my partner asked me to kick my friend to which I politely asked her to leave. This in turned caused me to use up all of my savings to the point I am now where I’m flat broke with 5k college debt still trying to finish school.

We worked on a budget to which it was implied that since I make 13% more than her, that I should be spending 13% more while she saves her money. I know in the grand scheme of us being together, we are a team. My problem is that I’m the only one trying to improve my career while she is not. At this time I conversed in the future I would be open to the prospect of spending more but that was ultimately me swallowing my pride.

Next, is marriage and kids. I feel better about getting married with her because before she was giving me a time frame to which I had to work with which I was again…okay with because I loved her but now that I’m in debt and working full time and doing full time school, the pressure is immense. She keeps talking about how soon we should get married and how she wants a house and kids… 

To swing back to the budget…we will never own a house or kids with the money we make and spend. I know that we just moved in together but I want to just break the lease and go into more debt and then move in with people to save more money. Emergency funds for us nor our pets are in the picture. She wants us to live for 8 months surviving paycheck to paycheck with the hope that nothing will happen emergency wise.

These are just the things that are weighing on me deeply right now, I will provide updates as they come but I really need some insight. 

We’ve also talked about couples counseling before but is upset that I never set aside time to do it even though I told her I’m always free.


Am I going about this poorly?





"
1o87ka5,"I 28M met my wife (27F) in college and dated her through COVID, we share similar values, culture, religion and have A LOT in common. Biggest difference that intrigued us in early days was that I was raised overseas and moved a lot for most of my life but I have been independent since I was 15. My wife on the other hand was born and lived in the same neighborhood until she moved out for college. 

We both happen to have been raised by narcissists and we trauma bonded on it. Our parents cannot admit they can do anything wrong ever and deflect blame all the time. We used to discuss how we would never be such partners or parents. 

Early years were great, we were in school, being kids and enjoying ourselves. After college, our relationship went through long distance for a year after I moved for work. It was rocky and she was very clingy and needy but we stayed loyal and stayed together. While I was learning how to be an adult and focusing on saving and getting myself ready for marriage, she was just waiting, she was depressed but refused to do anything about it. Fast forward to 2022, we got married and moved in together. Our first two years of marriage I was the sole earner while she was in grad school, she used the excuse of being in school to get out of any major life responsibilities. She didn’t share the burden of finances, didn’t worry about retirement and didn’t help out with chores around the apartment.

I like to consider myself as a high functioning adult, I am very capable of cooking, cleaning, dressing myself up, taking care of my body and everything I would need to. I also consider myself to be very dependable. She would come back from school and while I worked remote, I cleaned, got lunch/dinner ready and even picked her up from school. It was almost like I was a single parent. I started bringing up how she’s not carrying her weight in the relationship and she would deflect blame on me, things got really messy, hurtful words were said and I resorted to using marijuana because I found it difficult to be around her sober without bringing up what’s bothering me. I kept bottling up everything, I would go to therapy, we even did couples counseling and I was always told by her that she is the way she is because of me and because of how I’m a narcissist who’s trying to control whereas I just wanted someone to see how much I do and take some off of my plate instead of adding to it. My therapist said I have traits but I’m aware of them and curb them, he also told me that I should consider separating but with our culture and families it’s very difficult. The biggest financial abuse to me was that during this whole year 2023 she worked part time as a 1099 employee and I told her to set aside 30% for taxes. I wouldn’t keep a check or anything because I expected responsibility, when it came to paying taxes she only had 40% of her taxes saved up and on oops. You can guess where the rest came from. She had and still doesn’t have any savings or any financial literacy regardless of me pushing it. During this year, she paid for no bills, apartment, car, food, travel, gifts, mutual shopping, everything was done by me and all she spent her money on was shopping for herself and buying things that stayed in the closet with tags on until they were given to goodwill. This was a HUGE red flag to me and I told her if she doesn’t turn things around, I don’t wanna continue this. She would also use her body and initiate intimacy every time things would get rough.

In 2024 once she was done with grad school, she got a job in a HCOL area, we decided to move and since she was working, she said she would split bills. As soon as we moved here I found myself a new job and started making 40% more than I used to. This was my way of showing up. She on the other hand, told me what her salary would be if she worked 35-40 hours but in reality she worked 15-20 max. Her job isn’t the best and she refuses to change jobs because of comfort. I still take care of majority of the expenses but the expenses and her expectations have gone up, a random happy hour on Tuesday for $200 is very normal to her. She would in no way shape or form have the life or apartment she has if I wasn’t in the picture whereas I probably would be doing better alone.

Her family is rich but not wealthy, her dad is the breadwinner and if he stops working they’ll be on the streets but as long as he’s working they can keep up with the joneses. I don’t come from a lot of money so setting myself up financially is a very high priority but it seems like the partner I chose doesn’t share that vision with me. She’s very irresponsible in other aspects of our relationship, she doesn’t show gratitude rather just expects things. She treats me like her father at times and will say stuff that a teenager would say, the worst thing she said to me a year ago that I have still not recovered from is “I should’ve never married below me”. I continue to bring things up but there’s very little change. I go to individual therapy and she refuses to, even though I’ve set it up for her through my work. She doesn’t believe in couples counseling, she doesn’t even see the dentist or doctor or a ob/gyn. 

I am 100% accountable that I have not been easy, I have said things I shouldn’t have said, I’ve had trouble controlling my anger and I am still learning how to communicate and be better. I’ve never physically abused her but there has definitely been name calling. Every time I bring up change and growth, she tells me how her parents didn’t love her and wanted to get rid of her and now I wanna get rid of her, she hasn’t healed from her past traumas and deflects them onto us. Our conversations go me telling her how I feel, her telling me how I did something wrong and me apologizing for that and for sharing my feelings.

It bothers me how irresponsible she is, how unrealistic her expectations are, how detached from reality she is and how she never tries to understand me. She’s very loving and it’s amazing when it’s good but in terms of longevity idk how much more I can tolerate. I’ve spent my entire twenties on her. She also lacks ambition which to me is highly attractive in a woman, I come from a line of ambitious women and always wanted that for myself. When we are with people I find myself talking more to her friends or my female friends because we can talk about more than just shopping or TikTok trends. She doesn’t have answers to where do u see yourself in 5/10 years, how do u want things, when do u want kids, when should we buy a house, she doesn’t partner up with me on anything like that. I agree that it’s on me that I’ve let this go on for so long. She promises to change and I cling on to what it could be but I know deep down that as she is today I don’t want her and I’m not attracted to her emotionally. I love her with all of me but I don’t want to accept that she’s not right for me. There’s more examples of financial and emotional abuse but I think you get the patterns already. Our wedding itself was also messy, it seemed like she wanted the wedding day more than she wanted me lol. 

How do I make this work?

TLDR: my wife has been irresponsible and I haven’t been the best through it. She’s financially and emotional abusive towards me and refuses to do counseling or involve family/friends. Don’t wanna end the relationship and want to give it all the chances but don’t know what to do.

1q3gj6n,"I (19F) have been dating my bf (20M) for 2 years. I’m worried my bf loves me more than I love him and it makes me feel horrible. He’s amazing at expressing how much he adores me and always knows exactly how to comfort me in the way that I need. I couldn’t imagine my life without him and he’s my best friend on top of being the man I want to spend the rest of my life with. It’s hard to put into words, but I almost feel like I’m not capable of expressing that same amount of love whatsoever, or at least not at the same capacity. I feel as though what I can offer isn’t enough even though yes, I am there for him and I do make it clear how much I love him, mostly through my actions. This isn’t a matter of him not feeling loved, more so me not feeling like I’m capable of loving him as much as he deserves. I know he feels loved immensely as even when we were simply best friends he told me that my presence in his life had drastically improved his mental health which was in the gutter.

I’ve mentioned this all to him before without trying to make a conversation of it, so he is aware of my feelings. Since we began dating and even over the last year, my feelings have only grown for him. I just worry that he’s not feeling as much love from me as I’d like him to. Is this normal? How do I approach this as a topic of a discussion without making it seem like I’m losing feelings for him?

TL;DR- I’m beginning to worry that I can’t give my bf the love he deserves even though he’s the light of my life."
1okkyy9,"My boyfriend had sex with me a few months back and urinated inside me without my consent. He didn't even have the guts to tell me until the night after. I ended up having clumps of my skin come out of me that I thought was a miscarriage, he broke up with me telling me that he was evil and rotten and that he's so sorry.

He assumed it would be fine to do without asking me due to being okay with it being done in mutual masturbation even though I would tell him about my Endometriosis and getting ready to get phallo consults, so I really was looking forward to getting my female genitals removed and replaced with the male ones. I have pretty bad bottom dysphoria so the only reason I'd use my parts in the first place is to be intimate with him. I would do it even though it made me dysphoric because I love him.

I didn't tell him that I feel violated because I spent the majority of the time trying to console him and to tell him that he's not evil. This is the 3rd time in a year. We have been together for 3 years.

Before he officially broke up with me and we were still on break, he talked about going on Facebook Dating to see all the ""crazy people."" He says he deleted his account but still brings up the website. Since we're not technically a thing I didn't tell him off, but with his wishy washy ""when i'm better"" I can't help but wonder if he's hooking up with men while he's on this ""getting better quest."" I would like to add that he is legitimately suicidal. But I have been too, in the past, and it doesn't excuse any of this.

He got very deep into internet porn right before we got together at 15 and got into some pretty bad circles, but he kept continuing with the pretty intense kinks he saw through it. He's a whole foot taller than me so I kept repeatedly having to tell him that stuff is fucking terrifying because I can't push him off if he hurts me, but I gave in since he started ghosting me if I wanted to have vanilla sex. Got really into the puppy stuff he would watch (or wear stuff like it, anyway) because he would hold me after sex if I dressed in ears and a tail. I think he might of been addicted to furry porn in the past, not sure. I threw the ears he got me away, finally.

He went from telling me about his career plans to move to my city to being a asshole in 3 months since our anniversary and I am so hopeless. He invited me to go see a movie with him in Portland, 300 miles away from my home. I'd have to rely on him and the train."
1o6ae26,"Hello everybody, this is my first post on Reddit so it’s a bit long, but please give it a thorough read because I really need an advice. (English is not my native language so excuse any mistakes)

For a bit of context, me and my girlfriend started dating 3,5 years ago and before that we were fuck buddies. I love her very much, but I feel guilty about what Im about to share. 

At the start everything was amazing and we had no issues at all, especially in the sex department. However after a while I noticed the consistency of intimacy between me and her started to decline. I asked her if everything was OK and she assured me that all is well, but she has a lot on her plate at the moment. I left it at that and didn’t press the issue further.

Things didn’t change, in fact they got worse. I didn’t want to pressure her into talking about that because I saw it didn’t make her comfortable and I was fine for the moment. We moved in together about a year and a half into our relationship and were, for the first time, completely alone which meant we could do whatever we wanted, whenever. At that point we had sex once every 2-3 weeks (we used to do it every 1-2 days) and I was getting really frustrated because the topic was being ignored when we both knew things are not okay. The relationship at that point had become stale, and I was getting really worried. I thought it had to be one of several things. She’s cheating on me/thinking about cheating, she has lost interest in the relationship or I am not doing something right and she is not interested in sex. We talked and she assured me that it’s none of those things, however sex is not a priority for her anymore. I had to accept the answer no matter what I thought of it because I really did not want to pressure her into doing something she didn’t want.

Fast forward a year and a half and things became really problematic. We had sex once a month or 2 and our relationship was deteriorating fast. Whenever the topic came up I was left feeling guilty for talking about anything sex related let alone trying to initiate something. My self esteem took a massive hit and I started hating myself. Interestingly enough she began masturbating like 3-4 times a week, which made me feel even worse. Not the act itself as i see nothing wrong with it, but the fact that she was still interested in sex just not with me. I don’t want to sound like I’m flattering myself but all my previous partners have told me that I am not bad at sex at all, which made the situation EVEN weirder. 

Fast forward another year and we have reached a point where after a lot more talking had been done we have sex every 2 weeks. I am no where near happy but I am exhausted from all the talking and trying to figure out what went wrong. At this point I’m not sure if I really want to have sex it’s more of a “if it happens it happens”. I love that girl very much and I don’t want to lose her, but this situation has been going on for so long I don’t think I can stand it anymore. I have tried pretty much everything at this point and nothing seems to work out so my guess is that she is becoming asexual, if that’s even possible. I’ve shared this only to my closest friend and he told me that we might not be sexually compatible which hurts me a lot.

Please advise me on what the hell I’m supposed to do, because ending such a long relationship just because we don’t have enough sex sounds so stupid. "
1o3agtn,"From the beginning of this relationship I knew that my partner and I have very different communication styles, habits and needs. It‘s something we openly discussed right away and both have worked to accomodate the other. He does not like to text much, he prefers phone calls and ideally meeting in person if there’s something longer to talk about. I am more prone to overcommunicate and since I‘m more anxious I have always needed certain assurances. I am also someone who can talk with friends and family for hours.

I think over three years (& living together) we both have gotten better at accommodating the other. I have learned not to read things into his monosyllabic replies and he has learned to stay in touch when we have to travel for work.

But now I‘m deeply upset because of the following situation:

He put a trip with his friends into our shared calendar a few weeks ago on two different weekends. I asked him about it and he said, they weren‘t sure yet when it would happen. I advocated for the earlier date, because that was during a business trip of mine and against the later trip, which would be one of the few weekends we would both be fully off in months (and one of the few opportunities for us to go away together). The earlier date came and went, no more updates, no more mentions, they didn‘t do anything. I accepted that the next one could still happen but doubted it.

Yesterday I text him to remind him I won‘t be home for dinner because I was out with friends (for the first time since August), which is when he suddenly texts back: „Okay have fun and see you Sunday, I‘ll be leaving with the boys!“

The trip was entered in the calendar as lasting from this Friday to Sunday, but I always assumed they would leave Friday evening because he can never get out of work early and for sure not take a day off. I had asked him about it a week ago and wasn‘t even sure they‘d do it because all the planning they had was „rent a hut somewhere in the mountains“.

He hadn‘t told me they‘d leave Thursady, even though we sat together Wednesday evening and talking about my plans to maybe visit family next week (a trip I thought I had to cancel when some admin issues came up, which he promised to fix for me „during the weekend“ so I could still go). 

At that point I also still had no idea where they would be going. Their last trip was surfing in another country so my assumption was it could be anywhere.

I called him right away and he tried to argue that „it is in the calendar“ and that they would leave in the evening after work and he‘d work remotely from the vacation cottage they had rented. I repeated angrily that I still had no idea where that was but he went on trying to justify this at normal. I didn‘t ask again but said he should ask his friends if they think it‘s normal not to tell the person you live with when or where you are leaving to for three days and hung up. 

I blocked him in a fit of anger and because my friends were walking towards me and I didn’t want to ruin the evening but unblocked him about twenty minutes later. 

He never texted back or wrote until this morning when he wordlessly sent me the google maps location of their cottage.

Reddit, I really don‘t know what to do or how to react. I don‘t know what‘s normal anymore or how I should feel.

1omfnmq,"So me and this girl are both studying for the same bachelor, and that’s how I met her for the first time last year when we were both running late for a lecture and decided to sit together in the back. We had a small conversation and we walked a bit and we added each other on IG. Ever since then I didn’t really talk to her nor did she to me. It was just occasional hellos whenever we saw each other. 

She got this boyfriend from another study a while later and they were together until like late August this year. I had no idea of this so I just assumed she still had a boyfriend.

Now, how did I get in contact with her? I usually post song recommendations on my instagram notes and she happened to be a fan of one of the artists I put on there. So she texted me saying that and we started talking about music, then we started talking about life in general. It got really deep, she talked a bit about her boyfriend and about love in general. I reassured her about those things and I felt a sort of click with her. 

The next day we met up in person and we just had a long walk together. We talked about a lot of things. I complimented her looks and she did to me as well. We had a very long hug at the end of the day. I really liked her on that day. 

Few days later we met up again and I bought her a vinyl of her favorite artist and she absolutely loved it and she kissed me and we were cuddling a lot and talking about deep stuff again. I wish I could relive that day.

So then it kinda became official. I asked her if she wanted to be my girlfriend and she said yes. That was maybe a month and a half ago.

After that, we slept together like twice. We did a lot of things together. I loved every single moment.

I asked the reason for why she broke up with her ex. She said that he was basically not a man enough and that his family sort of hates her. But here’s the catch, they live on the same floor in the same apartment. He lives like 5 rooms away from her. And that really makes me uncomfortable.

One evening I decided to just check her location and I couldn’t help but notice that she was near the location of his room. I tried getting in contact with her by calling her but she wouldn’t pick up. Minutes later she called me back and I ask her how she’s doing and she says she’s doing great. Shortly after, she asks if I’m telepathic and she starts crying saying that she and her ex got in an argument together. I tried reassuring her and I was just being on the phone for her. She calls me again crying shortly after saying that her parents experienced an earthquake. I reassured her again. Then I called her again just expressing my concerns between her and her ex. I didn’t mention that I checked her location. I just said that I absolutely did not like the idea of them still being near each other while I’m miles away (For context, she lives on campus, and I live at home with my parents. And it takes me like half an hour to get there). She told me that their current relationship is just kinda being neighbors. Whenever she needs help, he comes and help. And I told her I don’t really like the idea of that. She said “well are you going to come and help?” I kinda agreed with her that it would be hard for me to come over if she needed help. She told me she will ask for him less. I was thankful for that. But I still felt uncomfortable. Because what if it’s all just a lie? I kinda let that go because I couldn’t focus on my studies. 

We met up the next day and she didn’t really seem herself. I read her a poem I wrote for her the day before. I talked about my feelings. And she hugged me, kissed me. And I felt a connection again. But something still deep inside of me couldn’t cope with what *probably* went down. 

It just wouldn’t make any sense. Why would she lie to me when I’m always there for her, and when all of my friends know her? Lying to me would ruin her reputation and it would just not make any sense because of how much I offer to her. 

I kinda let go of that pessimism again. Because I wanted to believe her, because if I didn’t, that would end it all right now. And maybe I’m completely wrong in suspecting her at all. 

That was last week. Yesterday, we met up again together to study a bit together. We had some intimate moments. And I felt like everything was okay and that I should never have doubted her.  But this morning, at this moment, I see her at that some location again, her ex’s room. And I am not 100% sure that the location is accurate but I feel like it could be true. And I don’t know how to tell or ask her about this without seeming like I’m spying on her when I’m just really worried. 

She publicly says I’m her boyfriend from time to time. We still share music recommendations on IG together. We have our own love language that we still use. Yet I feel something is wrong whenever I’m not physically with her. 

So here I am, I don’t know who to talk to about this. And I don’t know what I should do to express my concern to her without seeming like I’m spying on her. I still keep every conversation casual and not accusing her of anything. 

So how can I approach her about this without accusing her of cheating?

TL;DR: My GF’s location is sometimes in her ex’s room. She still expresses her love for me when I see her or talk to her. And it seems very genuine. I’m just very uncomfortable knowing that they’re near each other. I just want to express this concern without accusing her of anything. "
1p6u5gp,"ek. He traveled two hours from the city back to our hometown, so we began spending time together regularly.

Weeks passed and everything moved very fast. He confessed that he liked me and I liked him too. He did not give me time to heal, but back then I was too naive to think about it. I was the one who tried to win him over because he challenged me. After a few months we officially became a couple. We got along well and he had many female friends from law school. I did not know that was a red flag. I gave him my trust completely.

Months passed and I never checked his phone, but I had a feeling that I needed to. My accounts were on his devices, but he never signed in on mine.

During Valentine’s Day I found out that he and his girl friends from law school hid a story from me. There were 5 of them in the group and B was the only guy. He bought his friends chocolates. I bought him flowers for Valentine’s and I got nothing in return. He paid for our dinner, but he did not give me even a single flower or chocolate. I was okay with it, but the problem was that they hid it from me. His excuse was that he thought I might get jealous, even though jealousy was never a problem for me. I asked him every couple of months and his reasons kept changing.

One day I checked his phone and found out about a girl he went out with before and after we were officially together. He told me she was his relative. He had a classmate in law school who was the sibling of the girl he had been seeing. Later, I found out that they had a thing together and that they stopped talking only a week before he met me. My heart sank. When I confronted him he kept denying everything until his mom got involved and told me they did have something before.

To make things worse, let us call the girl Pinky. B’s ex, Christa, and Pinky worked in the same hospital as interns. B and Pinky met because of Christa and Pinky volunteered to spy on Christa while she was on duty. Eventually B and Pinky developed feelings for each other.

After that I broke up with him, but it was already too late because he had love bombed me and I became extremely attached. Another issue with B is that he liked recording us during sex. When we broke up, I asked him to delete the videos. He became angry when I held his phone and asked him to open his hidden files so he could delete our video. He told me I had no right to make him delete it because we were both in the video. This came from a law student, and I wondered if that was really how it worked.

Every time we broke up I would always run after him until I noticed something that had never happened before. I had green discharge and every month it became painful. Even when he just inserted it, I felt itching and pain. He said it was normal and I believed him. Now I know it was not normal. Many people told me to get checked.

That was when I realized he was sleeping with many girls. I confronted him and humiliated him on social media. The plot twist was that I ended up apologizing because I did not want my family to get involved anymore. Everyone else stayed safe and I was the one who took the blame. Even now, we have been on and off. I knew I had finally reached my limit. I found out he talks to many girls on Messenger and keeps them as options. He always stops using Instagram when we are together. He avoids using social media except for YouTube, which is suspicious because he was not like that before.

Now I just pray that one day this heaviness I feel will finally go away.

After a week of no contact, I finally had the courage to ask for my phone back so I can move on without thinking about it anymore. I could not stand the fact that he was using my phone to meet and message other girls. It is so utterly disgusting of you, B.

Last October we got back together, and he asked me to seek counseling so we could talk about where everything went wrong because we couldn’t have a formal conversation without pointing fingers and blaming each other. After that, everything was just forgotten and we went back to our usual cycle until I found out about the girls he was hiding on Messenger, along with a blocked male and female, and the fact that he was not using Instagram whenever I was around."
1pmgjx3,"My brother (25M) isn't the most discreet with these activities. He thinks others are deaf, blind or stupid. He is also mature enough to know this is weird as fuck.
One time I was in his bathroom and heard him moaning, another time I caught a glimpse of his screen while entering his room (the door was open and I had told him I was coming in so don't tell me I should've knocked) and I caught a glimpse of the screen and saw porn. So that's how I know he does watch. 
Where it gets invasive, all of us had to share his room for a night due to maintenence in the rest of the house, and I was sleeping on the other side of his double bed. I woke up to feel the bed moving and you can assume the rest.

Coming to the biggest boundary crossed, he has had to sleep in my room for a couple days while I sleep somehwere else, and last night I came to know he was doing it in my bed. I was mortified and I have no idea how to communicate this. We live in a conservative society so I can't be very open in discussing this. I don't even know how to talk about this with anyone so I'm coming here. 

Tldr: How do I communicate this to my brother that he can't watch porn in my bed, but indirectly? "
1ol1g6l,"If anyone isn’t willing to be mindful and understanding of an age gap, which is absolutely irrelevant, then please do not interact. 

My girlfriend and I met a year ago. At first, it was just a ‘fling’. We very quickly caught emotions, and started dating 5 months later. 

We had a very, very rocky relationship, unfortunately all from her side. There were many problems. We broke up in August, went no contact, and after a few weeks, we decided we both couldn’t take it anymore and found our way back to each other. 

Every problem/ issue in the relationship was resolved. And on September 7, she asked me to be her boyfriend. I said yes, and since then, everything has been great. 

Sex has always been a very important part of relationships for me, as it has been for her. She moved in with my family 3 weeks ago, she’s settled in, got a job and we’re both trying to save money to move out next year. 

But since she’s moved here, we’ve had sex like 3 times, and they’ve all felt out of pity/ she wasn’t completely into it. 

She gets seasonal depression, struggles with change and I didn’t know a symptom of that was just not wanting to have sex. It’s a very difficult situation, because she’s not doing anything wrong. She does not owe me sex, nor does she need to please me, but I can’t help but feel extremely down about it. 

The dynamic was always a very sexual one, making out and having sex the second she’d be in my room, teasing over text, doing it too much if anything. And to go from that to once every 10/14 days is just… difficult. 

We’ve spoken about it a few times, but it seems an unsolvable problem. I simply tell her that I’m getting down about it, and that I don’t want her to feel guilt, but when she says she doesn’t know what to suggest, I just feel… sad? She’s been very vocal about saying it’s not a me thing, nor does she suddenly not feel attracted to me, for context. 

If anyone, girl or guy, has any advice to handle this, please let me know. "
1p7odaj,"so i (19f) am currently dating a guy 22m) i love him alot and 6 months back i got a proposal from my extended family that guy was 28m. i said no that time but meanwhile my family got to know about my boyfriend and they dislike him alot because he is financially not very fine and his family also has backwards thinking like their way of talking and dressing is quite different from us. My boyfriend is very educated but he doesn't do job he works on his family business.On the other hand this proposal guy is very rich and his family is well educated when i first saw his picture i didn't like him at all because he was veryyy different from me(i am very petite and he looked very old in the picture) and ofcourse the age gap between is very huge according to me.but now my parents and my brother met him in a family gathering and they are telling me that he looks very different in pictures and they are telling me to meet him once and since then they are constantly talking about how nice would my life be after i marry me.my parents have clearly said that they will never let me marry my boyfriend and they have threatened my boyfriend's family also to not support us. 

i will not lie but for a moment i was inclined towards meeting that proposal guy once because i am a little scared about my boyfriend’s family like even if he gets financially stable and can love me a lot his family might not let me be me because of their mentality.i really really love my boyfriend alot and we have gone through so much things together but i don’t like the life i will be living when i marry him(he won’t get separated from his parents) on the other hand i like the life that proposal guy is giving me but i am scared that i will never be able to love him and i can never forget my boyfriend .

its like choosing between life and love. i am not going to choose between two guys but i am going to choose my whole future 

how can i come to one decision?
please help me in making the right decision."
1omr3n4,"I (30m) live with a (57f). We’re in a kind of “situationship”. I’ve lived with her for over 2 years now and we’ve been the only ones in our lives for honestly about 7 years now. We’ve been hooking up for years now and it’s whatever. It’s not ideal for me but it’s working for now. 

She has a daughter who is 21. Her daughter has a bf who is 23 or 24. Now obviously the mom likes younger men because she’s obsessed with me and acts like I’m her bf and tells me how much she loves me. She’s divorced as of probably 5 years now but separated her husband when we met. 

Just the other night, Halloween it was. She was sitting on the floor while her daughter was on the couch doing her hair in braids. The mom was wearing a jean skirt and had her knees bent, legs open and apart while on the floor. The daughter’s bf came in and sat in the chair directly across from her and she the mom didn’t even close her legs. I was right there. Witnessing it all. I remind you that I’m sleeping with the mom and she likes younger men. I am horrified. She didn’t even cover herself up and I can’t help but to think that she just flashed her daughter’s bf her panties. She’s very flirty like that. 

Once her daughter was done the daughter walked away momentarily. Only then did the mom briefly use her arm to cover the hanging skirt but then uncovered it! At that moment I stood up and said don’t you think you should cover that up? And she acted dumb and was like ok yeah. She left her legs wide open, bent knee facing her daughter’s bf while I sat right there witnessing her do it. She claims that she wasn’t aware but she gets off to doing freaky stuff like that. She’ll wear no bra and walk in front of her bedroom window and I have to remind her frequently we have neighbours. I was so mad I just left the room. 

I confronted her after they left to go take her bfs younger brothers trick or treating and she was super defensive and said I had a warped mind. I couldn’t/ can’t help but feel betrayed and hurt. She’s acting like everything is fine and is actually acting with more excitement since we’ve talked. I feel like I busted her and called her out and now she’s feeling like she’s getting away with it and it’s giving her energy. Like you feel when you do something wrong and get away with it. But I know she’s flirtatious and she probably got off to it. 

She says she only does things like that for me and I said exactly. She says that she was sitting like that already when he came in. I said so? You wouldn’t think to close your legs??? A woman wearing a skirt just flashing her pussy to another man and her daughter’s bf. I said if I had my pants down and her daughter walked in I wouldn’t just keep them down id pull them up!?

I said you probably knew it was happening, got an arousing feeling from it and then ran with it like nobody knew you were doing it. But I was right there watching her because I’m aware of her flirtatious sultry demeanour.

I’m going through so many emotions. Part of me wants not to care because I don’t see her as part of my love life nor my extended future. But we’ve been hooking up and in this situationship for years. She’s never that I’ve known cheated besides this act of exposure. I feel like the opportunity arose for her and she took the moment to expose herself to her daughter’s bf. I was right there.

I’m taking this as a time to heal. We haven’t spoke about much since Nov 1 because she gets mad and denies it all. She’s had a narcissistic past and I feel like she’s gaslighting me into believing I’m crazy. I’ve dealt with narcissistic people in my past and this reminds me exactly what I went through before them trying to convince me I’m crazy. 

The unfortunate thing is because of the crazy rent market right now, I just signed a 1 year lease starting Dec 1 with her. I know I’ll have my own space and that’s the saving grace. I want to end this situationship. I would leave if I could but I’m stuck right now. I feel so betrayed. "
1o029m6,"My husband and I have been together for 16 years (married for 9). We also share two children aged 6 and 3. My husband has a long history of depression and occasional abusive behaviours. We have a good relationship 95% of the time, a similar world view, goals, sense of humour and good team work. Though whenever we argue about something (difference of opinion, my raising an issue with something, etc), he is very quick to anger if I don’t agree with him. He goes from zero to yelling, swearing and name calling. He often will become physically violent in that he throws furniture, punches walls, stands over me. He has also threatened suicide or implied he is going to commit suicide then gets in his car and drives away and turns his phone off - this has occurred a few times. He has only a few times been physical with me, once where he pushed me into a shower screen and then got on top of me and started choking me, he’s pushed me a few times, blocked my exit or followed me around yelling when I try to walk away. He very often raises his hand to hit me, but doesn’t. This has occurred in front of the children on a few occasions, and once he went on a rampage in front of a house guest and their newborn for a period of 3hours. I’ve told him many of times this is abuse and not ok and given ultimatums that he needs to get help/stop or I’m leaving. He always apologies the following day, says he understands it’s not ok and promises to get help. But he hasn’t sought meaningful help, and often starts to change the story to me not being perfect and doing XYZ to cause this, or pulls the depression card. 

It’s just happened again, and I want to leave him. But then again - I don’t. I don’t know how, I don’t want the kids growing up in a broken home, and I want to believe that he is going to change this time. We’ve booked marriage counselling, he has been looking into psychologists. But I really am not sure if I can trust this will solve the issues. I am afraid that this will escalate further. But I just want him to stop and for us to live a happy and long life together. 

I’m seeking advice/experience on what I should do. I don’t know if I am overreacting or if this is a situation I should leave. Thanks"
